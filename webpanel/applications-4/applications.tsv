5/30/2015 16:38:13	http://www.reddit.com/user/iiM_HaVoc/	UTC+1	17	no	no	-	Pretty helpful for lower ranked players and can help alot I think	Well... I am 17 from Germany currently LEM in CSGO. I speak fluent english and would love to take a little responsibility in the community :P and I am online pretty much all week !	13-18 months	Overall pretty cool but as always the "dumb" minority sometimes is the loudest
5/30/2015 16:40:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/Ex3ctum	GMT+2	20	I have some experience in HTML and PHP	Yes in CSS	Very cool thing!	It is nice to have those, there is many new players to the game	Im average joe from Finland been playing cs around 7-8 years now. Gaming is my passion.	19-24 months	It is nice. I used alot HLTV.org before
5/30/2015 16:45:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/ImTippsy	GMT+0	16	I have some experience in HTML and PHP	Yes, I hosted many servers and administrating many servers in many games, I was a admin in quite a few cs@go servers, pref surf.	I really enjoy it, good way of interacting with each other.	Nothing I can say really, I love the idea.	My name is Jamie, I'm 16 years old from Dublin, Ireland. I spend a lot of time at home usually on my computer administrating various servers and playing games in my spare time(csgo obv) but I am also into sports. I am easy going person thats not afraid to start a conversation but when people try undermine the rules I don't go lightly. I stick and do whatever im told.	10-12 months	Most people are quite on-going and not afraid to share their thought no matter what while others are easy going and like to help others.
5/30/2015 16:47:34	https://www.reddit.com/user/huddy987/	GMT-6	15	I have a very limited (next to none experience of JavaScript and Onjective-C) I took beginner courses on both of them about a year ago.	Yes I hosted a Minecraft server a few years back.  Recently I also created a private dedicated TeamSpeak and CSGO server on my computer using port-forwarding.	I think it would be nice to have them on a weekend night that way it's easier for everyone to get involved.		I love CSGO and have been playing it for a year now. I'm not the best but this game sure is addictive. I am very organized person and I hate it when there is something out of order or crazy. 	10-12 months	This community is amazing. It is growing rapidly and never ceases to give me a chuckle on a bad day or cheering me up when I get wrecked in MM.
5/30/2015 16:52:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/AppemanxD/	GMT-5	16	No	Have experience, not in the counterstrike series however.	Community Night is a good way to get together but is a bit too disorganized in the rankings at points. Its not as fun when you are a high rank facing lower rank or vice-versa. I played it a while back and had a lot of fun, even found some map errors and submitted them, but that was the biggest issue to me. Rankings made it a bit less fun as we didn't have enough variety of rankings.	Similar to /r/lol I feel this is a great way for newbies to learn, however I think maybe their should be of these more often but I don't know how to do such a thing. For instance, you have people wondering these questions for a week that can't find the answer to something, so they have to wait that long to find an answer? People most likely won't respond to the old thread if its not stickied so its harder for "newbie" players to get the answer without waiting for too long.	I'm currently in high school, recently got my license and I'm looking to buy a car right now. While I spend hours wasting time finding lemon cars that are not worth the time, I spend a lot of free time browsing the subreddits I follow. I run cross country, played lacrosse for years and I'm an avid skier. I love to listen to a variety of music, from Katy Perry, to Rise Against, to Schoolboy Q, I listen to it all. I don't really know how to answer these questions well because they feel just like a way to list off things about myself when that isn't the true purpose of the question but rather to tell a story of your interests.	10-12 months	I feel when you look at /r/GlobalOffensive from an outside perspective the subreddit looks a bit immature at points, people always talk about a vocal minority, but on reddit that minority is easily the loudest. In the case of the "hackusations" a few months back after KQALY's vac, we had no reason to truly believe whether or not players like Flusha were hacking, yet the subreddit went all out to try to take down these players and their names. I feel that the subreddit needs to take a more official stance on these players, the subreddit already crucified these players and their careers, for no reason other than suspicious activity and some random guy on the internet who was right about KQALY hacking.
5/30/2015 16:53:56	http://reddit.com/user/BaseballRJP	GMT-4	15	Yes. I know a large amount of HTML, and CSS. I know a little bit of PHP and Phyton. 	Last year I was an Admin of my own server on another game (Minecraft) and Admin on a server I found. My server was hosted on Peak Hosting, and we ran many minigames, attracting over 500 players. I was admin of the other server for a long time, and I helped run a majority of it. I was not apart of the decision making for hosting. We ran a faction server and had about 100 members. 	I think is great. It gives everyone a chance to participate in the game, and give their input. The community seems to be torn apart by many of Valve's decisions, and I think Community night helps bring everyone together. 	I feel newbie Thursday is a really good thing. Many people who make new posts about "stupid" questions usually get downvoted and ignored. Newbie Thursday is a great way to help these people's questions be answered. 	I started playing CSGO last year, and absolutely love the game. I have around 300 hours and am currently GN2. I love to be involved in communities, not only this one. I am an active member of many forums and always try to help people out. I think that if I have a skill, I should try to share it with others, and help them out. I am a Sophomore in Highschool, and plan on helping to establish an eSports team at my school, if I can get the support of my friends. Outside of CS, I love playing Baseball and Golf. I'm not too good of a golfer, but love playing it. 	4-6 months	To be honest, I think our community is a little bit toxic. Don't get me wrong, a lot of people are helpful, and answer questions. But, a lot of people also are just mean to new players, and to people trying to share some of their CSGO moments. Too many people try to criticize Valve and say they are just trying to make us mad. I think people need to be more understanding, and open to new ideas. Regarding the current mods, I really do not have a problem with them. If anything, they are not active enough in my opinion. 
5/30/2015 16:56:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/Gusdl	GMT+2	17	Yes. I have some experience in coding a website with HTML (I also have some examples if you wish!), made some tools in Javascript and used PHP on Linux DEBIAN.	I had some succesful german CS:S and CS:GO communities. May I list them down here: CS:S: Brotcrunsher; Paradox and Timeless.  Currently owning an own linux dedicated server with 32GB ram. So if there is any need, as example for community night, I have a lot of servers for you!:)	I really love it! Were there 2 times and made some nice contacts. But there is one problem. For a lot of newer players it is a bit hard to compete with other, often high-skilled players. So I think there is only one solution. Make servers rank based. I know some people may lie and it's hardwork, but I'm willing to do that:) It will be much better for everyone.	Perfect!	Hello!:) My name is Simon and I'm 17 years old. I play CS:GO since the official beta and played CS:S for 4 years. I'm currently finishing my school in germany.  Ingame I'm currently LEM and often switchting between LEM and SMFC.  To my personality: I'm open for everything, never rude or anything like that and always want to help!:)  I'm also currently working for csgoteamfinder.com as a coach to help newer players master the game.  Hopefully I could convince you with my bad english grammar!.p  See you soon and happy fragging!  Greetings, Simon Maiwald	7-9 months	It's a nice community. Sure you get some trashtalk but that's normal. If you have any serious questions, you will get serious answers. 
5/30/2015 16:56:05	http://www.reddit.com/user/uli6969/	GMT+3	16	No	Yes hosted 10man servers for me and my friends familiar with rcon and all the server commands	More often if possible.	Not sure if they are very helpful, the only way you are going to get better is by playing, not by reading about how to play	skilled@cs, plays way too much, also tryhards pugs.	7-9 months	People like to circlejerk and complain too much like the pistol nerf and the MM cheaters, otherwise its a fairly non toxic community that is happy.
5/30/2015 17:02:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/Shizrah/	GMT+1	17	None.	I was admin on a Trouble in Terrorist Town server on GMod for quite a few months until we decided to shut it down, as we were no longer active. I don't know the specifications on the server host, as my friend took care of that, but I do know that it was filled very often, as it's a popular mod.	I have not participated in a Community Night, but I think it's a good initiative for people who want to have fun. I would never participate in one, though, as I am not that type of person.	Very useful, even for more seasoned players. It's a place where you can ask any kind of question to improve or re-adjust your playstyle, and I really like it.	This is a pretty broad question, so I'll just start where I think it's right: I'm a 17 year old boy (soon 18, whatever) from Denmark, who's recently gotten into Counter-Strike (around 400 hours since November 2014, never had any previous CS experience, but I've played many other games). I usually go to school (after summer it will be equivelant to senior in high school) from 8:15 to 13:50 or 15:30 on weekdays, so I'll be home 40 minutes later. When I get home I'll be playing CS or watching streams and browsing reddit (I'd also like to mention that I translate CS:GO from English to Danish, which allows me to look through all the strings in the game and get an understanding of what the updates bring). I could tell a lot more about myself, but I don't feel like it would be relevant. I already mentioned a bit in the previous question about trying to be independent from the hive mind, but I feel like I am obliged to mention that I can be slightly "trolly" (for lack of better word) at times, where I am passive aggressive or try to anger my counter-part in arguements where I know I am right. I also like to make jokes. Not everyone appreciates them in real life, but thankfully reddit is as socially inadequate as me and like them. I can't think of any more, but if you have any questions I guess you can always contact me, if we get that far.	7-9 months	I don't know about the mods, they seem okay, at least I rarely see shitposts that are solely that. I do not agree in the way they handle critic of for example Thorin (almost always instantly removing the thread), but I suppose rules are rules. But where do you draw the line in this case? I remember quite a few threads being extremely negative towards other famous persons from the scene which were not removed and instead lingered on the front page for some times and got a lot of comments.  As for the community itself? I can't say I like or dislike it. It really depends, but unfortunately I see it a lot as doublemoral and... well, arrogant, in a way. Often you'll see the most upvoted comment being one side of things the one day, then exactly opposite on the next. It's always explained by "multiple people are on reddit", but we all know the buttons for upvote and downvote are there for everybody, so the same opinions should stay across a few days. I don't recall how it was when I began, but around DHW, with the Flusha witch-hunt and Fnatic-scandale, I noticed that the community can be extremely volatile and the part that isn't will be acting like they're saints who're always right. I won't bring my own opinion on this, but the fact that so many people always act like they're superior really annoys me. I guess sometimes I'm one of them too, but I actively try to avoid being one of the "mindless" followers on reddit, where I see an opinion and I imitate it (and it often happens that I upvote the top comment and then think "wait a second, this is not how I feel at all" to remove the upvote and instead articulate how I feel myself instead)
5/30/2015 17:03:16	http://www.reddit.com/user/stolennn1/	UTC+2	21	HTML, very little Javascript, PHP, CSS . Java, a little C++ .  Some shell scripting as well heh^^	I used to admin servers back when I was playing CS1.6/CSS for fun, after touching the competitive scene, I didn't even join public servers anymore (just DM). 	Unfortunatly I haven't been able to take part of one yet, but I think it's a great way to get people sharing the same passion together.	I think it's extremely helpful even if a lot of questions pop up every Thursday. 	Well, I'm 21 (soon 22), I live in Italy and work as a sysop for a national project. I've been playing CS since I was a little kid (touched it for the very first time in 2001-2002), and in 2009 I started playing competetivly. After 2 years of "climbing the ladder" I managed to play for the best CSS team in Romania. I then switched to the italian scene, where I played the last CSS EPS season and finished 2nd place. I then switched to CSGO while it was still in beta (january-february 2k12), and it slowly grew on me (even though it was pretty rusty back then). I've been playing it since then on and off, last year had my first 2 LANs, which I finished both 2nd with the same teamt (EPS Romania 2k14 and EPS Italy 2k14). In january this year I stopped playing because I started working and I didn't have the necessary hours to put into the game anymore. Recently I've been switched to a night-only-shift-kinda-shit and I have a lot spare time I don't know what to put in. CS has always been my passion, and even with those 2-3 months of breaks in between cs sessions, it still manages to call me back one way or another. I won't lie, I still have to learn a lot about reddit, reddit rules and so on, but I'm pretty confident in my CS background and experience.  Thanks if you took the time to read this :) 	2-3 years	I'm not going to lie, until a recently I really didn't like it. I must say there's a lot of content that has nothing in common with me. The subreddit got a lot better nowadays, and I browse it every night.
5/30/2015 17:03:21	http://www.reddit.com/user/thcthsc/	GMT-7	19	A little bit of java	I do not..	I feel that they have potential to gain much more popularity	love them, great way for the community to interact together and help one another. The whole outline with the FAQ's are spot on	My name is Tim and am currently attending uni (at least for another week) until summer in Seattle, Washington. I am currently applying to the CSE and informatics department here with some experience in Java. In CS, I am an LE with around 940 hours and 332 wins. I frequent r/globaloffensive all day every day and is my go-to subreddit on my phone or as soon as I turn my computer on. I like to interact in threads that I find engaging and get along with the community. No matter what happens, I'm all for the growth and improvement of this subreddit. I just want to see it grow and I'd totally be down to help.	13-18 months	i love the community as a whole and am very proud whenever we reach a landmark or gain some popularity. The people are generally helpful, nice, and have a sense of humor (though there are some crazy assholes out there, cant have a perfect community). As the community grew since I joined over a year ago, it seemed to become more and more like a shitpost subreddit, but with the clean up jobs by the mods recently it has been looking much better.
5/30/2015 17:06:20	http://reddit.com/user/dunzeod	GMT-6	23	nope 	nope	cool idea, but never works into my schedule of being able to play	awesome idea with so much new attention GO is getting. 	working guy who lives with his gf that really likes cs. I like running. I haven't been into cs for the longest time(only since last November). I have a dog. He's pretty chill.   I work as a journalist/photographer. 	4-6 months	It has become very chaotic in the past couple months. It has become a sort of place to advertise skins and repeat the same bugs over and over again, with a couple of highlights by pro players themselves. The worst thing is the comments. There are way too many angry people on this sub that are very vocal about it. I still read all of it because there are some really interesting things, but overall the quality has dropped a bit. I also think that the real problem is with the game developers. They honestly seem to not care, and I mean that's fine... They've created a great game, but I feel as though if they don't update their game bugs, then their long standing playerbase (the ones with a lot of knowledge of the game) won't stick around, and a better alt will come around and replace this game. I also really hate that the mods have to be super neutral. You Guys are part of the community with your own opinions. Keep your moderating unbiased, but let your comments shine with who you are and what you value in the game. 
5/30/2015 17:16:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/GymShowers/	GMT-4	19	Yes, mainly do PHP but I can mess with bootstrap.	I don't have experience with CS:GO servers but do have experience with a Minecraft server I owned. I ran it for about a year until I lost interest and it averaged 30 players online.	I don't have any thoughts about it. I guess it is good to involve the community in things and get feedback.	Good idea. I started playing CS:GO again recently and it helped a lot since I wasn't that good to begin with.	I'm a college student currently on summer break. I don't really post a lot on reddit except when something interests me or I have a question to ask. I'm not super out going.  I'm not sure what to say other then I'm fairly laid back and spend a little bit too much time on my PC.	0-3 months	It is basically like every community, you have the good posters and then have the trolls. I like a lot of the content that comes out though.
5/30/2015 17:18:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/Addward/	GMT+0	23	Usage of HTML/CSS/Python/Javascript	I am an admin for Marvelous Gaming Servers, a branch of highly-modded L4D2 servers. They use sourcemod/metamod (a plugin which is also used on CS servers for Arena/DM/Retakes/etc), and I'm also in the process of joining together with a friend of mine to launch some UK-based servers, primarily for people in the UK scene to develop as players.   I have also previously been an admin for IRC networks (AlphaChat), led strike teams in large groups of 100+ (RRF, Urban Dead), and pull together all these experiences when I'm helping in a new community.  Experience moderating servers such as these has given me a lot of perspective in community relations and fairness.	I enjoy it! When I play it43 I do it's amazing to see the community coming together, regardless of rank. It bridges the gap between experienced players and newer players.	Useful! I want to contribute more to it definitely - the non-judgemental way that questions are answered, and the way it is moderated is really good to see.	I'm from England, and I currently work full time with plans to go back into education next September to study Business & Marketing. I mostly play CS, with a good helping of L4D2/GTA/whatever games are in my backlog. I played a small amount of 1.6 back in the early 2000's, before dipping into consoles until building a new computer in April of 2012.  I love festivals, nights out, strat roulette, TOP BANTER LADS, and generally being a chill bro. I pretty much get along with anyone if they're cool with it!  In short, if I join the team I hope to be an example of patience, humour, and good will. I'm pretty chilled out, and I'm not gonna be that dude who causes drama for the sake of causing drama.	13-18 months	I think the community is well moderated, although "circlejerky" content like the recent Phantoml0rd thread needs to make sure it keeps a good balance between sharing of opinions, and mindless bashing of players/streamers.   I think it's done well, but I think it's an area that could cause friction in the future, so the moderation team should always be open with the way rules are enforced in threads that have arguments.
5/30/2015 17:23:44	http://www.reddit.com/user/applep13/	GMT-3	14	No, I have 0 experience with that stuff. 	I was once the admin of a Facebook page with like 1000 likes. That means I'm cool, right?	I think it's a very cool thing, and although I've never been able to participate I would love to do so, or help out with organizing it with summer coming up.	Very useful information. I find myself learning some things I didn't know with 1800 hours. 	I'm 14 years old and going into highschool next year. I am a huge CS fan, and was once an avid trader until the jackpot ate my skins (or I just went, "fuck it" and threw all my skins away. I go with the former) I have 1,800 hours+ in CSGO, and GO is my first CS game. I like hip-hop and I'm on my computer 9/10 times when I have free time. So like, I'm always on. Always watching.	7-9 months	While I think with all the shitposts lately the quality of the subreddit has decreased slightly, but other than that I like the community. I feel like current mods do a great job at their "job", but I would love to help out :)
5/30/2015 17:31:51	http://reddit.com/u/BrastaSauce	UTC-5	17	Yes, growing up I dabbed a lot in Python, LUA, HTML, CSS, and C#. However, I'm currently nearing the end of a class in Java, and wrote the CSS for the subreddit I created, /r/DeepIntoYouTube. I am currently rewriting the CSS of the subreddit to make it cleaner on a test subreddit, though.	I have never moderated any CS:GO severs, but have experience in moderating servers from both Garry's Mod and Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas.	I do not pay attention not participate in Community Night. I am willing to change that if need be.	I think it's beneficial to the community, and have participated in helping a few times.	Well, as previously stated, I created and currently moderate the popular subreddit /r/DeepIntoYouTube with a few others. We have received countless compliments as moderators of the subreddit, and frankly have been told we are some of the best they've seen from the community. If you go to the current sticky, you will find a list of important posts at the bottom where there, you can find what people say about our moderating (specifically "No Brigading or Witch-Hunting).  Aside from moderating, Counter-Strike is currently my favorite game although I've only been playing for a bit less than two years. I browse /r/GlobalOffensive practically by the hour, always keeping up with news and the content that is posted here. I am currently Supreme, not that it matters, but shows a bit that I'm dedicated to the game.  Oh, and /u/trollabot tells me this is my favorite subreddit, so there's that ;D  Anyways, thanks for the opportunity and I'm looking forward to hearing a response from you all!	13-18 months	When I first joined, I thought it was great. As time goes on, however, it's seemed to have filled with new players and I see a lot of them being rude or posting irrelevant things. I do still think this is the best forum for CS:GO though, despite the obnoxious community there is sometimes.
5/30/2015 20:45:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/teamfailz/	GMT-4	16	None whatsoever..	I moderated focs betting group and am going to moderate Lopezomgs top frag betting group this month. 	I have never done community night.	It helps because out community is growing fast as hell and it lets people learn meta and help eachother	I was a Judge for multiple Yu-Gi-Oh events. I moderate multiple betting groups. I used to mod for bookie.gg (thanks for taking my spot jpon9) but due to an "altercation" of sorts with the main guy I was removed. 	7-9 months	People are quite rough on eachothers and on differing opinions. 
5/30/2015 17:28:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/azalea_k/	GMT-4	40	Some HTML, and a little BASH shell scripting.	With running a server, I previously set up CSS and War mod PUG plugin over Sourcemod as a trial. Also have run a Chivalry dedicated server in the past. I have not run any for CSGO, though, but was an admin for a popular at the time clan Insatiable Gaming which for the first year or so were the busiest NA 20 man public server.  My occupation is ISP network engineer and I have full access to many core routers and switches, along with UNIX servers, which goes to admin experience somewhat, in my opinion.	I am a regular attendee of the NA night and enjoy it immensely.	I am glad to see it and would contribute more if others didn't already.	I am relatively well known in the Twitch CSGO community and until a few weeks ago was a news writer for ESEA. I would like to say I'm impartial in terms of the services in competition with each other, and use all three from time to time (the three being the NA popular ones - Faceit, CEVO and ESEA).	2-3 years	I'm a mod on #r/globaloffensive on QuakeNet and enjoy talking with people there.   Otherwise, there has been a constant influx of new people to the community which I'm glad to see. There is a prevailing anti-Reddit sentiment on the ESEA forums but I feel this dismissive attitude is unfair and unrepresentative because of the vastness of the difference of views held and expressed by Redditors.
5/30/2015 17:35:22	http://www.reddit.com/u/Svenskaren/	GMT+1	21	Very basic experience in HTML, CSS and PHP	I have a Teamspeak 3 server running 24/7 that im hosting for me and my friends. I fiddle around a little with a cs go server i also have at home.	No input :(	I think its great that new players can have a place to get help with the game and also to talk with the community.	Im a 21 year old guy from sweden currently working but i will start going to school again in a month. In 5-6 years i will finnish my edu. and start working with computer engineering.  I have played cs go since 2013 so not that long. 	10-12 months	I think r/GlobalOffensive is going in the right way. Community is getting Bigger, i feel like everyone in the GO community is at the same level. e.g. Silvers kan talk with globals if you get me ;)
5/30/2015 17:38:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/GreatMemes	GMT-5	17	Nope.	Yes, I am a two time former headadmin of two Garry's Mod servers.  fsas.info is the website, the two communities I was a part of came together into one and eventually Garry's Mod just got boring for me, so I moved to CS:GO.  	I enjoy them, and occasionally join in. I'm usually working those nights, but I try to get on and sometimes get in towards the end of one of them. :)	It's a helpful Q&A for new players, useful for new players.	Good luck reading through the thousands of responses...  So, as you already know, I am a former headadmin of two (evidently became one) Garry's Mod server.   I might joke around a lot (with a name like "GreatMemes" what can you expect :P), but at the end of the day, I am a very kind and easy to get along with guy, I think. Lots of people recognize me and are good friends with me on the subreddit. I know how to handle people and situations well so everyone leaves happy. I've been involved with the CS community since I was 14, so about 3 years ago when CS:GO came out.   I'm 17 and am working part time at my local A&P, I play CS:GO (ranked MG1) in my spare time, and enjoy the reddit community. I live in New Jersey, USA. I understand what would be required of me on the subreddit, and as someone who frequents the subreddit more than your average user, I feel I could be nothing but helpful.   Have fun reading through all the troll applications guys! Pick someone good!	0-3 months	The guys on the subreddit aren't your average guys. They're nice, helpful, and considerate. I enjoy the guys on the subreddit more than the kid screaming in my ear ingame.   Reddit > pretty much the rest of the community
5/30/2015 17:38:58	http://reddit.com/user/boelicious	GMT+2	29	a little in html and C++ but nothing too serious.	I'm server administrator in my real life job and host servers since cs 1.5 times.  Atm my 10 man community has about 70 people and plays every evening.  We got 3 servers running most of the time with some self scripted sourcemod plugins.	Great thing, wanted to participate but didn't had the time or we already played our 10 mans.	Also a great thing, i try to help people as much as i can if i got the time to post on thursdays.	As already told i'm a full time server administrator from germany and passionated about esports. Beside my working day and my hobby on the computer i love real sports. My friends and i try to meet once a month to play football. Four times a week i also train in the gym.	10-12 months	Most of the time like almost all subreddits. We hate things we loved yesterday and love things we hated for months.
5/30/2015 17:39:18	http://reddit.com/user/Mr-B0j4ngl3s	GMT-4	24	I have a small amount of Javascript experience, but I'm extremely rusty. Also a little bit of C++ when I used to edit plugins for my CS 1.6 servers I managed. I can generally understand code and fix small problems assuming the code is written neatly.	I currently co-own 2 Linux servers and a windows server with a friend of mine. They are hosted at my friends small hosting company he used to work for. I've been managing servers since I was about 16 or 17 years old. I have experience setting up servers, and installing all of the necessary plugins. I used FTP and RDP to manage the servers and spent a lot of time in the servers as the head admin. I managed a 24 slot 1.6 assault server under the brand SuXoRs gaming for years, and we had the original and most popular CS 1.6 zombie servers as well. We had about 100+ players on our servers at any given time. We have been looking at getting into hosting CS:GO servers, but have been focusing most of our time on other games such as DayZ and Arma 3 recently.	I think community night is a good idea. I've never personally played in a community night event so I can't comment on how efficiently they are run, but it would definitely be something I would be interesting in helping with in any capacity. With my old servers we had a community fun server that we used to play test fun events with the members of our community in CS 1.6 I personally wish the customization in CS:GO could reach the levels of customization that CS 1.6 and CS:S saw.	I think any way to help out new players is a great idea. I see a lot of people post in Newbie Thursday, and it seems to help a lot of the players with questions in there. I think any idea that fosters and cultivates the newer players in CS:GO is extremely beneficial to the community. It helps bring the new players information they might be too intimidated to ask about elsewhere. It also gives veterans a way to share their knowledge and experience with the community in an open environment. I definitely think it's something that should be continued to help this game grow. A lot of peoples first experiences with CS:GO might not be great, but if you can provide people with information and give them some confidence they will be more willing to continue playing and helping grow the game and the GlobalOffensive Reddit.	My name is Jack, I'm 24 and I've been playing Counter-Strike for about 11 years under the nickname of Bojangles. I played a lot of CS 1.6 and skipped out on CS:S and moved from 1.6 to CS:GO. The counter-strike franchise has been a big part of my life, and I've learned a lot in my time playing.  When I was about 16 or 17 I started administrating CS 1.6 assault server with a community called SuXoRs Gaming. I eventually became the head admin, and from there I became a co-owner and general manager. I loved managing the admin team, and reviewing bans. I spent countless hours in that server, and on the FTP editing configs and fixing plugins. After a while we decided that CS:S had a very successful zombie plugin and we wanted to bring that to CS 1.6, so we worked with a plugin developer on bringing a good zombie plugin to 1.6 We opened up a zombie server and found it full 24 hours a day at 32 slots. We then opened up 2 more and had 3 zombie servers that were bustling, and an assault server that kept it's steady playerbase and had a loyal community. We organized fun nights and generally had a good time with our players and admins even though we never earned any money off our success. Our players from the assault server were generally more mature than the younger zombie players and admins, but we kept everything in check. As the game slowly died we had to scale back on servers, and we finally closed down the servers when there wasn't much interest left in the game. I honestly wish I could go back to the plain fun 1.6 was, but with CS:GO I've turned my focus elsewhere in the scene. I've been slowly growing a competitive team, and we've been competing in ESEA and CEVO for a few seasons now under the SuXoRs Gaming logo. I've spent most of my time in CS:GO playing competitively and doing a lot of trading. I was very active in trading in the earlier days of the Arms Deal update, but I've since slowed down and only collected skins I personally wanted to use. Currently I spend my time doing schoolwork, reading reddit, playing competitively, and watching twitch streams. I am currently a moderator in C9 | Shroud's stream and have been doing that for about 7-8 months. I was also previously a FaceIt admin for a few months after they posted looking for admins in the /r/GlobalOffensive reddit. I parted ways with FaceIt when I realized there were problems with their system that left me spending countless hours working alone in their support system. They had admins that wouldn't show up, and I was left to do the job of 3 people over the course of 3 hours. I didn't feel comfortable being essentially forced to cover other admins shifts even if I had plans. I left on amicable terms, and hold no ill will towards FaceIt.  I hope you consider me for a moderator position in /r/GlobalOffensive. I would be more than happy to serve time as a trial moderator so I could learn the ropes. I've not had the opportunity to moderate a sub-reddit, but I think I would have the skills and time to help in any capacity the team saw fit. Thank you for your consideration.	19-24 months	I think in general the /r/GlobalOffensive community is mature and fairly non-toxic. There are always a few bad eggs in every community, but I think for the most part those issues are handled via the reddit downvote system or moderation. All of the users will have different opinions and some of them will be liked, and others not so much. I've made posts that people love and agree with me wholeheartedly, and posts that people dismiss or completely disagree with me on. I personally like the fact that not every one of my posts is going to be well received. I like either having the opportunity to sway people towards my side, or possibly have my opinion changed on a subject. the sub-reddit creates an exchange of ideas that can help grow the game as a whole, and I think that's what the whole point of the sub-reddit is, to share ideas on making the game better.  I've been a part of this sub-reddit since I think a little bit before the Arms deal update came out. I had just returned to the game because I am an FPS player at heart, and was sad that CS 1.6 was dead/dying and I needed to play a new CS that wasn't source. The sub-reddit was extremely small back then, and I think as its grown it has stayed relatively the same. The sub-reddit has seemed to avoid a lot of the problems like other sub-reddits such as /r/LeagueOfLegends has had as they grew. I don't always post a lot, but I am on this sub-reddit reading and watching videos for hours a day.
5/30/2015 17:39:31	http://reddit.com/user/mustard-man/	GMT+12	19	I have limited knowledge in CSS, not incredibly confident though!	I have had my own server which I use to play 10 mans with my friends, and I had a small steam group which we organized pugs on the fly for a bit of fun when we didn't feel like matchmaking! I can operate an rcon and such, I can't say I have much experience dealing with strangers as an admin.	I think it's especially a good way to help a community member with a map they are in the process of designing, I think it's really cool when we see a member of /r/globaloffensive submitting some WIP images of the map they are making and everybody is really excited about it enough to try out the map and help out the user. I live in New Zealand so I've never really been able to participate in the community nights, although I would be interested in setting up a partition for Australia/NZ. (Servers, Teamspeak/Mumble and such) We play Counter Strike down here too!	I think it's a good judgement free place for new players to find out things that they are unsure about in counter strike. I know from personal experience that (in-game) people can sometimes be unforgiving to players that don't know certain things about the game, so I would say a lot of players appreciate Newbie Thursday	Well, I'm Tom from New Zealand, I have been living here since I was three years old (moved from England) I recently finished high school and am currently in a part time job so I have quite a bit of spare time!  I produce music in my spare time, play counter strike or go on reddit. And uh yeah. that's me!  Good luck finding your guy!	19-24 months	Well... It's quite big now! (Which is probably why you're doing these applications) The community can have some, er.... bumps now and then but overall it's a place that I appreciate and enjoy coming to every day to see what's happening.  Also, I find people seem to have a huge obsession over CS:GO surpassing DoTA 2 from some reason, very strange....
5/30/2015 17:39:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/Malfane33/	UTC-5	22	No	No	It's a great way to play a game of CS with some people who aren't totally judgemental and intent on ranking up or trolling.	I feel like it is particularly helpful to newer players, and I have even used many of the tips myself.	I would enjoy this chance to have more of an opportunity to be more interactive within the subreddit. I like to contribute when I can, and I know for a fact that I am very easy to get along with. (Plus since I'm graduating from school, I'll likely have more free time on my hands to dedicate to what is required for this position)	10-12 months	I don't interact with the other users much, but I do enjoy the discussions that take place on the sub. I feel like there is an overall mentality that may be expressed that is very common, and often that may shift over time, but there is enough of a variety that any sorts of "unpopular opinions" aren't likely to be downvoted.
5/30/2015 17:40:36	http://www.reddit.com/user/_Hybridz/	GMT+1	18	I took IT in college. Studying all aspects ranging from hardware to HTML coding. So I have some experience with HTML websites, but not an extensive amount. I'm an IT engineer so software/hardware is my forte. 	I am currently an admin for Team Secret Force (MG/Zombie riot clan).  http://team-secretforce.com/  I have been with them for over a year, moderating the forums and being an active player on their servers. Our server owner TumTum owns a Linux server and hosts the CS:GO server off there.   Secondly in my younger days, I created, moderated and paid for a Minecraft server, I know MC can be looked down apon as a kids game, however it taught me the fundamentals of server ownership. I coded ranks/plugins and advertised the server myself. It was successful however I lost interest after 2 years.	Sadly I haven't been a part of community night so far, although I'd like to be.	I think it's a great idea. It saves users having to make new threads just to ask a question, and they tend to get a quicker response.	Well, my name is Tom, I'm 18 and from the south of England. I'm an IT engineer and tend to work a lot of hours, which ends up me reading the reddit constantly at work (shh). Although I haven't been with CS from the start, I feel like a genuine part of the community (Started on CS:GO).  I'm a MGE in-game, with like 1.6k hours, but most are on the Secret Force server I mentioned above.   Hope this was great for you guys (and grills) to read, thanks for taking the time!	7-9 months	Overall, the GlobalOffensive community is phenomenal, I read the subreddit every day, and the ideas ad suggestions that come out of this subreddit are genius, so much so that Valve turns to us for creative ideas. Now obviously we get trolls, haters, and generally angry people, but they can all be dealt with, and the community as a whole does a great job at silencing the stupidness. I honestly haven't had much experience with the mods on this subreddit, not sure if that's because I'm doing things right, or wrong, but hey, I do see their comments on peoples threats occasionally and they are great to read. Like when Olof posted his AMA, one of the first questions was from a mod about olofpass.
5/30/2015 17:43:59	https://www.reddit.com/user/_CookieBandit/	UTC-4	15	No.	Yes.  It was hosted by a provider in Texas, retake and 1v1 servers. I made sure people did not flame, grief, or cheat. 	I love community night, and I love seeing interation between fellow redditors. The /r/GlobalOffensive community should interact and I'd help administer it if needed. 	I love it! I absolutely love helping newer players!   I've adopted 4 silver players and 1 nova.	I'm a 15 year old student. I used to admin/run minecraft servers and their forums. I am an avid Cs:GO player, and I love seeing how this game has improved and grown over the years. I'm not really a wordy person, I'm fairly straight to the point. I'd love to help /r/GlobalOffensive reach an even better state, and I love making people happy. I have around ~1k hours in the game if I add my old account. I have a lot of knowledge about the competitive scene, and I even cast some games. I comment a lot, am fluent in English, I know a lot of Spanish, Some russian, and a lot of Hebrew. Thanks for considering. :)	19-24 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community has changed in such a way as it has become so much lager. From 40,000 subs to 220,000, I see an influx of newbies and people willing to add to thew community.   Oh yeah, and that AutoModerator guy is a dick. /s
5/30/2015 17:43:11	http://reddit.com/user/Genericamel	GMT-5	19	Fluent in HTML and CSS, ruby and python. In the process of learning Javascript and nodeJS will follow swiftly.	Administrative duties on a CS server no. But I have been a crucial part to a major Mine craft server that had a 24/7 uptime a few years ago. The Server was hosted with Bro hosting before the company went under. Bukkit was used to host the plug-ins. 	I think they are a wonderful idea. The GO subreddit is a beautiful place with over 250K+ subcribers. Why not get the community togeher for some play time. My favorite thing about them are the general acceptance, it doesn't matter if you are a silver or a DMG, it's very easy to feel accepted. Along with that being said it's an easy way for some of the newer player to pick up some tips and tricks from the older players.	Much like community night I think they are a wonderful idea, it gives the newer players a thread to ask general questions and get advice. That prevents alot of the repeated questions and frustration from older players that see the same question often being asked. 	Hello! First of all thank you for considering my application! My name is Xavier Judy and I am a 19 year old computer science Major, I only discovered the wonderful world of CS:GO around a year ago. About 3 months, dozens of cases opened and 1 knife later after I was introduced to CS:GO, I found /r/GlobalOffensive. I might not eat, sleep and drink CS but This subreddit is definetely somewhere I visit multiple times per day. It's almost like a daily ritual. Wake up in the morning with my coffee and /r/globaloffensive. Beats the local paper any day. Even if you guys dont select me to be a mod I wish all of the current mods the best, you guys are doing a spectacular job! Keep up the good work.	7-9 months	While I haven't been in the community long enough to see any huge changes, one thing I have learned is I love /r/GlobalOffensive. There really isn't too many things to criticize, the hot posts of the sub are all high quality and free of spam and trolling (most of the time). As mostly a lurker I just sit back and read. My final hough is that our humble community is far less volatile and way more organized than most other subreddits, there are very few things from a viewers standpoint I have to critize.
5/30/2015 17:40:57	http://reddit.com/u/InclementDeath	GMT-4	17	Nothing impressive, Virtual Basic / Lua. I have a book on HTML and am a willing learner if need be	Yes, I moderated some older retake servers. Besides CS I also owned and moderated DayZ / Arma / Rust servers. I also have experience in leadership via High School board work. And owned a CS team for a short time, prior to us going our separate ways.	I think they are great, I've attended a few myself but they tend to fall on my team practice times. I think its great to give some notice towards some more unknown maps	I also think it is great, as I dont respond very often unless the question is unanswered, but it is a good way to teach newer players game concepts that they would otherwise learn much later in the game	I currently have 2.6k hours and am Global Elite. I play the game very often and am on the hunt for a team at this point. I spend most of my time on PC and due to my multi-monitor setup one monitor normally hosts Reddit; therefore I spend a larger amount of time on this site / sub. Beyond that I use Alien blue whilst in school but that wont be an issue seeing as summer is coming fast. My moderation time can be anywhere from 7:30am - 10:00pm (Weekdays) and 10:00am - 11:00pm (At Least) [Weekends]. Anyway I hope you consider my application in the hiring process, hopefully things can go well and I can contribute to the community in the best of my ability!	10-12 months	Besides the trolls and heavyset bet crying, it tends to be quite positive. Good advice and helpful pointers. Sometimes the wrong comments get downvoted but that's just reddit.
5/30/2015 17:41:38	https://www.reddit.com/user/beef_nib/	UTC+0	17	I have a basic understanding of html	I've ran minecraft servers from my own and other pc's using my own network in the past, I acted as a moderator on the server but it didn't see much popularity.   I've been in a moderator position in a Garrys Mod server in the past also before I quit playing the game.  	I'm glad they allow all skill groups to play but I've never participated in one. 	They helped me a lot when I first started playing the game properly instead of just 10v10 casual. I see them as a valuable resource for people who want a good starting point. 	I'm currently out of education so I have a lot of spare time, I start college in September which is three days a week so I'd have lots of spare time to mod the sub.   As for my personality I'm usually quite quiet in most situations and try to listen more than I speak but I like to try and voice my opinion or at least argue my point until I'm proven wrong or see it's going nowhere.    And as for counter strike I'm pretty bad at the game to be honest but I'm definitely getting better. (GNM with 102 wins)  	10-12 months	I feel as if there should be tighter rules regarding what should be posted to avoid the numerous, my fps is fluctuating; vac authentication error; high ping etc.. threads. I also think the community is far too harsh on the developers of the game and act blind to the good updates just so they can complain about what are often minor gameplay tweaks. 
5/30/2015 17:42:30	https://www.reddit.com/user/mlgloaf/	GMT+1	14	i tried to learn some c++ and some python, but never created anything elaborate with it	back in tf2 i was assistant admin of a server a friend hosted, and kept the server running when he was away. i was the assistant admin for about a month, and so can't vouch i have much experience in being a server admin.	I think community night is a great way to help all the people on reddit get together and play together, without having to worry about ranks or skill. It's also very easily accessible and i can see why it would appeal to every skill level. there's a lot of comments on how great the mods are at controlling the servers while also being friendly.	I'd never heard of newbie Thursday but the concept of it is something i'm very interested in. helping people out with questions they have about the game is something i'd like to do very much, and it'd be a fun past time as i'm very frequently home with nothing to do.  As well as being interested i can see it making a real difference to the people on the sub as they can learn from their mistakes/questions to have a less stressful and more enjoyable game.	CSGO is the only game i have played for almost a year now, and i started playing 2 years ago after getting it in the steam sale. There's something about competitive games that i really love and i want to strive and get better at the game to take it on to a competitive level.  my original plan was to start trying after completing my a levels and graduating, so if i didn't succeed i'd have my qualifications to fall back on and be able to get a stable job, keeping CS as a hobby instead of a serious game.  I want to be a mod so i can help people in the subreddit as people have helped me in it so many times over. I know chances of me getting the position would be slim to none but the chance is still there, so that's why i decided to apply.  	19-24 months	cs has steadily become much more trading oriented over the past few years and posts in the /r/globaloffensive sub are much less frequent than posts in the /r/globaloffensivetrade sub. i haven't found a mod in any of the CS subs that has acted unfairly or rude and appreciate the mods on how fairly they deal with the issues in the sub.  
5/30/2015 17:48:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/ZanezzLoL/	GMT+1	17	I have experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  Currently in a UK college studying coding, have been doing HTML and CSS for the past 6 months and JavaScript 4 months before.	No, although I do often play community servers.	N/A	Very useful to help new players improve, I've learnt a few things from it.	17 Year old from the south of England, currently in college studying IT, including Networking/Hardware, Coding/Website Design and E-commerce.  Been playing CS:GO for almost 2 years on and off, around 150 hours on my main account and almost 600 on another however I did get banned on that account for being stupid (was in a boosting group that hacked multiple times but I've made sure never to go back to that).   I've been gaming since I was around 9 years old, starting out with Runescape and WoW, then moving towards League of Legends, Hearthstone and CSGO.  	7-9 months	The community has definitely improved in the past few months, I was a little worried posting my first time but now everyone does give at least somewhat constructive 
5/30/2015 17:50:19	http://www.reddit.com/user/GreenDoomsDay/	GMT-4	16	I can do very basic HTML/CSS, although it wouldn't me my strongpoint as a moderator, because I find myself chipping in more of a moderator than a coder of subreddits I've helped in the past! :)	I haven't admined a CSGO server itself.	I think community night is a fun way to get to know and hangout with people in the community, when I played it, I did quite terrible and loved the friendliness my team provided me when I was not doing too well. I just think Community Night is a good addition to the sub!	My thoughts on newbie Thursday is that it's a good way to get help and give help. I just find that it gets filled REALLY quickly with comments usually, so perhaps a goal could be to find a way to make more helpful things like that so that it isnt as busy in one week, if that makes sense? ;)	Ever since I was younger, I always knew I liked to help people (I know, its cliche to say that in an interview process, but its true, I promise.) I found fun and happiness in volunteering starting at a young age (at a habitat for humanity store where I helped customers for example.) After getting into gaming and online communities, I was part of a minecraft community, where I help moderate one of the subreddits.   I like moderation, and using my permissions to help people out (may that be handling situations on a specific subreddit with ease/care/patience), but people have to understand that because they have certain permissions/power, it doesn't make them less human or less creditable than anyone else. I like engaging with people and showing them that friendly people are the best kind of leaders, and that is what I strive to be, not only online, but in real life.   I was the President of the student council, so working with a team, and throwing ideas and coming up with plans/strategies is my strongpoint. I look forward to potentially moderating /r/GlobalOffensive with you guys, if you decide to take my application.  I decided to add parts about in real life, as it shows more about me then telling you about what kind of houses I built in Minecraft. ;)	4-6 months	My thoughts on this community, is that it's a good place to come as usually its pretty friendly, and especially on the subreddit where its community controlled (downvoting rude comments etc), and mod controlled (removing spam etc), it makes it look very good as opposed to a less controlled community. (League of Legends I'm looking at you).   
5/30/2015 17:53:25	http://www.reddit.com/user/luciferrukin	GMT-4	16	Unfortunately not.	I may have had some experience, I did some admin service for a KZ/BHOP server. I don't remember the exact name for the server, it was not a large-scale server. 16 slots or so, was started in Toronto.  I remember just managing trolls and kicking AFKs that just came for a slot. I didn't do much beyond that though.	In my personal opinion the Community Nights are fun, they're a good way to kill time, play with friends, meet new people and most of all they give some gameplay back to the original map maker. I have joined a couple of times under the name "AaronSparks"	Newbie Thursday helped me before I signed up for an account, usually my questions would be answered. A few days after going through the subreddit I created an reddit account. Newbie Thursday fills a gap that would be there without it.	Well I told a little about the reason I signed up for reddit and my feelings toward the path of this community in the previous box. My real name is infact Lucifer, quite an odd name if I do say so myself. If it does bother you guys, I can create a new reddit account with a different name. I have had to use different names in school and such. (Ridiculous, I know)  "When asking one to talk about thyself, one will not remember anything of value." ~That's one thing I learned when getting interviewed for jobs. I applied for quite a bit recently. I got into nightshift at a graveyard. Many people ask me "Isn't it scary with graves?" which is followed by a quick reply "What are dead people going to do? Pop out of the ground?". I manage school and my job pretty well. School from 08:30  to 14:45 . Work Usually comes about 01:00 to 04:00. A lot of personal life revolves around school and work. Most are irrelevant and boring. I don't lead much of a life.   Regardless of getting in or not, this reminded me. I should probably post a lot more and reply a lot more. I feel like I could offer something of value to this community.  Thanks, Lucifer A.K.A Luke (P.S you should get people to apply with resumes through E-Mail and get google conversation interviews.) would be cool.	7-9 months	When I signed for reddit, it was for this subreddit. I thought that by signing up for account I would in turn naturally be compelled to reply to posts, comment and create new long analytical posts. Unfortunately when I had an Idea for a post, someone already posted a much smaller version of what I had in mind. Not to take credit from those posts, they're fine. I just thought the community is gradually getting away from the long posts we used to see talking about the growth of e-sports.   Many of the long and informative posts usually end up advertising their newly made website, not that it's bad, just is now expected. 
5/30/2015 17:56:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/Draulon/	GMT+1	17	As a game developer I have experience in minimal C-Sharp coding but that uses the reference library of a game engine so I dont think that would be useful for you guys.	Mostly Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 servers, but for enough time that I am familiar and experienced on how a moderator should act and think.	I personally think that It does not involve the community well enough, but given this is a subreddit and not everyone is interested in getting to know each other - it serves its purpose for the more active members.	I have no problems with it, everyone answers questions and is friendly. A great thing.	I am 17, from Hungary - and I work as a game design lead at a game developing team. My hobbies are betting, trading and martial arts. I never really wrote longer texts about myself but I think that I am a sensible and calm guy. I know how to manage larger communities thanks to my position at Age of Aincrad so I believe I can help a lot moderating the subreddit as an avid cs:go player and fan.	7-9 months	It is way better than the HTLV community that is for sure. So far I have never had any problems with it except for a few cases but that got quickly resolved as well.
5/30/2015 17:57:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/nisk0/	GMT-5	17	I know little of HTML Java and CSS	I am a North America FACEIT Admin	I think community nights are great, they allow everyone to come and play CS as a real community. You get not only just have fun playing, meeting those new people, learning more about each other, you'd be surprised who you meet. 	Good for all the low level players learn more about the game, it gives them the opportunity to get better. Let's them learn rather then just queing for a MM game and possibly losing to cheaters/smurfs.	Well i wish to major in Computer Science and engineering, possibly getting a job as a Computer Hardware Engineer. I love just playing video games! (If that wasn't already known)	19-24 months	I think its great, from the elaborate and educational posts to the down right serious. Its a great party and i don't intend on leaving anytime soon. 
5/30/2015 17:59:51	http://reddit.com/user/partyboy690	GMT+0	24	Yes, professional software developer, C++, Python, C, Java and assorted web languages	I setup and maintain my own private server for friends.	I think it's a good thing, we can organise events and tournaments for all skill brackets.	Yes I think it's good thing because there are some genuinely helpful people here and I know I used advice for getting out of silver	I'm usually the person who tries to motivate bottom fraggers and shut down toxic people, it's literally the worst thing about the game for me. I'm a professional software dev who works on server side software and I have knowledge area in this aspect of the game. I also like metal, playing RPG's and playing CS:GO.	10-12 months	I think there's a lot of toxic people on there, lots of people downvoting for no apparent reason, but there are some good knowledgable who like to help
5/30/2015 18:00:09	http://www.reddit.com/user/georgeoj/	UTC+12	16	Very basic JavaScript	I've been a moderator of a group of CS:GO community servers. The server types are   -BunnyHop -1v1 -Minigames -KZ -FFA DM -Retakes  First moderation work I ever did was for a clan called pA when I was 6. I know, I was young as shit, was a cocky little cunt and had no idea what the fuck I was doing, but I applied and got it somehow, pretty sure I lied about my age. pA (Psychotic Assassins, cringy I know) was a clan for a Free to play quake clone called Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, a game I loved and still do to this day, although I no longer play because there's no New Zealand/Australian servers. pA dissolved and became |H*S|. This clan got huge. Started out with 2 servers on ET, and at its end when the clan members split into 2 clans, it had 3 BF4 servers, 5 ET servers, 2 TF2 servers, and a Minecraft server. I moderated for them at a higher level because I was a bit older, at the age of 10.  I left |H*S| for *CKA* another ET clan but this one was American, I was too young to understand ping at the time of course but I was perfectly happy. The clan was run by a guy and his wife, these guys were the nicest people I ever met. The clan dispersed around 2009, and that was my last moderation work I did for a while. Fast forward to when I was 13, I met a guy on Minecraft classic called Arthurk, and quickly worked my way up the server ranks to become the co-owner of the server. I did a lot of moderation work during this time. You see, Minecraft classic was a lot more complicated than people think. Sure the concept is simple, build, get judged for the build, and get ranked for the build. But admining it is a different story. I could put a block down and tell who's built there since the last time the server shut down. My job was to ban greifers or people being mean in chat, and they were in fucking abundance. It was a free to play game, so of course some would come back, but when IP bans were added to the mod that allows for admin commands life got eaiser.   That server shutdown around 2011, I got in contact with the owner on facebook and we've been mates ever since.   2014, I became a moderator of www.twitch.tv/muselk's stream. He's a TF2 youtuber with 200,000+ subscribers, and his chat gets about 1000 viewers, who are particularly young and like to talk a LOT. My speedreading has increased dramatically since I started doing this moderation work. My job is to time out people spamming chat, meaning they can't talk for a set amount of seconds. I also have to control the songlist, and delete songs that are inappropriate. I have to change the title and game of the stream in accordance with what's being done.   Lastly, last month I became a moderator on Muselks TF2 server, which is just where I have to ban rule breakers/mute squeakers etc.  Sorry for all the writing, just had a lot to say	Never participated due to ping and time zones. But it sounds like a great way to meet new players and form friendships within the subreddit	Great way to help new players	Im a 16 year old kid living in New Zealand. I've been playing video games ever since I first tried Halo 1 on Xbox and PC when I was 3. My first experience with CS was 1.6, when my friend pirated it and let me play it. I fell in love, although I could never get the game because my parents wouldn't buy any. I currently have 618 hours, although I don't play much competitive as I'm only ranked MG1. I play competitive TF2 in AUS/NZ UGC Highlander as scout.   	19-24 months	GlobalOffensive is by far my favourite subreddit. Mainly because I know that whenever I visit the sub reddit during my day theres always high quality content, unlike a lot of other gaming subreddits. It can be witch hunty, like when everyone and their mother thought that flusha was hacking. Its almost like a bi-polar person you know?
5/30/2015 18:02:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/WeRSpecialPeople/	GMT-5	18	Have some college credit in wed design. Plus learned Lua, HTML, a little Java, and did some Python and Binary.	I own a Gameservers Server for my Clan (Tactical Gaming). I run an Introductory  Squad there to teach people the game.	None really, this and Newbie Thursday should keep being done, brings the reddit community of Global Offensive together.	Look at my feedback for "Community Night".	I live in a small town, so I don't really do much. Hopefully going to College in the Fall for Cyber Security. Went to Basic Training for the US Army but got Medically Discharged because of my back at week 7.   Like I said above I am in a clan and teach people that either have no experience or a lot of experience already.   I went to a tech school to learn about computers more, so I know a lot about Hardware/Sofware, Proramming, Networking, 3D Animation, Video Making.... need more on that?  I guess that is all, except usually I am available 24/7 if my phone rings loud enough.   If you want to talk to me more or something contact me at beaverpwnsall@gmail.com or add me on Steam, my username is TG Beaver.  That's all, thanks for reading my Application.	10-12 months	It is actually amazing. The people there usually are very friendly and insightful. They WANT to help rather than to just troll. I go on there everyday for news about roster changes and updates to the game.  The mods as they stand right now I don't have a problem with. I never had to deal with them yet. 
5/30/2015 18:03:07	http://reddit.com/u/Captain_Ozone	GMT-5	21	I can do very basic HTML 5 (as in, I took a few Code Academy classes), and im taking a Python class this upcoming fall.	I haven't adminned CS:GO servers outright, but i have worked with rcon before in CSGO and in previous games (namely, Wolfenstein Enemy Territory). 	Community night is pretty good and organized well. I think if possible, it should start a half hour earlier, because I notice the lobby is full 30 mins before start-up.  Also, move to team speak (Jpon too cheap?). I know there is a problem of linking channel speak and there's no app for it but for global announcements you could assign each player as they come into the server a tag/flair and have the admins set their whisper list to include that tag and they would be able to communicate with everyone atleast.   Consider either having it two nights a week, with either dual playtesting nights (of the same map) or split community and playtesting. The latter of the two would split the population I think too much. I would think a Wednesday/Saturday split would work, as it avoids regular update schedules and allows for weekday and weekend players to participate.		I'm a 21 year old psychology student from Chicago, I've been playing online multiplayer FPS' since 2003 with Wolfenstein: ET, where I used to be an admin/member of the |>B<| community (RIP in peace ET). Ich spreche Duetsch und englisch aber mein englisch ist besser als mein deutsch. I've played CS: Source and Zombie Escape Mod, never touched 1.6 or Condition Zero. Games I play now are: Guild Wars 2, FFXIV:ARR, Dirty Bomb, and CSGO of course, but I also dabble in Heroes of the Storm and Red Orchestra.   I don't play MM that much, but would like to get Overwatch some day (120 more wins), I've played on a CEVO open team, but have never played ESEA. I was a C9 fan until Hiko left some time ago, but I'm not really a Nihlium fan either, more of a Hiko fan (Disclosure: I am in the HikoHomies group).  I've been going to the community nights for over a month now, Jpon knows me as the guy who likes to stir up Epona. I try to facilitate people joining the servers when I can, but I also like to start conversations in the mumble. Particularly about the WarOwl. Why? Becuase why not.   I'm more or less on the subreddit all day, but for the next 8 weeks I'll have work between 7 AM - 3:30 PM CST (GMT-5). I don't post because anything that I would have to add has already been said most of the time, I like watching the comments evolve over time then injecting myself into them. But I have posted before, just not in the GlobalOffensive subreddit.   I don't know what else to include, ya'll seem like a nice bunch and do a good job, I'm just here to help.	10-12 months	People like to say the community "went downhill after X subscribers" or after "X update" but really its been the same since I've been reading. At its core, the sub-reddit is still about: gameplay/mechanics "suggestions" (slowly transcending into "Valve broke X!!!!!", but there are still good threads posted) pro-scene news (all the major events, roster swaps, cheating scandals, etc.), and hints/tips on how to play.  Lately though, the subreddit has seen an influx of twitch related content, for better (VODs, informational streams, tournaments) and worse ("Why is X popular?" Check out this X dollar donation! Crazy!"). I know there is probably a ton more that are published that don't make it to the front page, but I feel like their relatedness to CSGO is being streched in order to voice an opinion about a particular streamer/subject.   Alot of this stuff comes with the territory of a growing game and sub, but it feels like each couple days being "Game is broken and unplayable" followed by a SFM video or a thinly veiled attempt at posting a meme/reference for recognition. Maybe start a /r/GlobalOffensiveMedia for all things SFM, frag compilations, montages, that hilarious totally random grenade teamkill video you have, stuff like that. Or maybe a weekly "Show Us Your Work!" thread meant for all the artists who make skins, videos, wallpapers and etc to showoff.  TL;DR - Its still alright, but due to a rising population has become less CSGO game oriented (mechanics, bugs, fundamentals) and more vanity oriented (skins, betting, streamers/VODS).
5/30/2015 18:04:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheBCG616/	GMT+0	18	No	No	Community night is a useful way to allow people to connect with the community from the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit	Extremely useful for people such as myself who are relatively new to the game. Although personally I prefer to find things out for myself, my brother recommended them to me when he was a "Newbie" a couple of years ago.	I'm an 18 year old college student in the UK hoping to attend university next year, however over the upcoming summer I have a lot of free time. My CS:GO experience is a lot less than many other applicants, being only a Gold Nova 3, but I hope my knowledge of the game begins to make up for that. My passions apart from gaming are science and theology, so I guess thats kinda cool. No doubt if one of you were to examine my previous posts you will see. I got into gaming aged 8 or 9 with a PS2. After a brief hiatus over the start of secondary school, in Year 10, aged about 15 I began to get into playing CoD competitively, whilst watching CoD and CS. It was not until christmas this year, after finally mustering the funds for a basic laptop, I began to play CS.   Thank you for taking the time to read this, and good luck on your search for new moderators. :)	4-6 months	Its a lot better than the community on multiple other subreddits, and the puns dont hurt either. Although no community is perfect, the learned people of the subreddit are helpful and considerate as opposed to the majority of those on /r/CoDCompetitive where I try to be the voice of reason amongst people with little. Thats why I like it here, there are clearly people who think about what they type and are interested more in improving the game than gossip about pro players.

Best Regards!	13-18 months	
5/30/2015 18:07:28	http://www.reddit.com/user/DignitasMichael/	GMT-4	16	I have some experience in Adobe Dreamweaver. However I've only created basic websites on that service. 	I used to be an admin and a moderator for :  (I was  a moderator for the Trouble in Terrorist Town Server) http://switchyentertainments.co.uk/forum/index.php/ .   However, the servers went down after there wasn't enough donations to afford the costs. 	Community Night is great for new players who would like to play and learn from others. Like everyone else we have to all start somewhere and I feel that the Community Night is a great way to give new players a way to meet and play with other players. 	Newbie Thursday is pretty helpful to players who might be afraid to ask people questions in-game since they don't want to get flamed. Obviously no one knows everything about the game so this gives players a source to learn things that they always wondered. 	My name is Michael and I'm currently 16 years old. I'm also currently a trial writer at Team-Dignitas.com. (Sorry if my reddit looks like it was just created yesterday I solely created this to post my articles and guides). I started playing Counter-Strike Source a couple years ago. However, around  a year and a half ago I decided to move to Counter-Strike : Global Offensive after my friend hyped it up. (Good thing he did :p) I also feel that I have a lot of knowledge about the game that I could definitely use while a part of the staff team. Also, I feel that I can use my experience that I gained from writing articles and guides to help better me. Also, the thread said that I have to be online frequently. Don't worry I'm supposed to post 1 guide per 1-2 weeks and it won't effect my availability. 	10-12 months	I feel that the /r/GlobalOffensive always seems to bring up interesting problems about the game and other issues in the community. However, I feel that there is some frequent flaming and witch-hunting threads that I find  uncalled for. 
5/30/2015 18:07:30	https://www.reddit.com/user/GoldLobster/	GMT-7	17	No I do not.	I’ve had a little bit of experience admining CSGO servers. I used to admin a CSGO server for my team to practice on so I am bit familiar with some of the commands. I do however have some more past experience admining game servers and various forums. Here are some of the places i’ve moderated for.  * PlayMindCrack (MineCraft Server) - I’ve been a moderator here for just about a year. I became a Sr. Moderator on this server about 6 months ago. My job here has been to keep the chat clean and safe for users of all ages, also spending a lot of time specing games to catch hackers. All moderators are required to submit evidence when we ban users. So I have gotten in a good habit of keeping evidence of everything I do.  * Xat (Chat Site) - I used to be a Sr. Moderator of Xat’s help chat and various other chats on their website. I was a mod there about 18 months. My job as a Sr. Mod at the help chat was to help new users understand the features of the site. Also my job there was to answer any FAQ and if they had a specific question or topic I recommended them an appropriate chat.  * My site (Club Penguin Forum) - About 5 years ago I used to own a Club Penguin forum. It had a decently large user base around one thousand users. My main job there was to remove any spam and improve the site/forum design.	Community nights are one of the best things you guys do. It's great that the community comes together to have a fun night of play testing maps.	I think Newbie Thurday's are a great way for new users to get their questions answers. I personally love reading through the thread and helping if I can. 	Hi! I’m Victor I’m 17 years old (I turn 18 in two weeks). I’m originally from Belgium and have a pretty strong Belgian accent. I currently live in Las Vegas and have lived here the past few years. I’ve lived in Belgium,Spain,Italy,France,Florida and California.  I’m mainly a night owl and do most of my school online. I’m a huge sports fan (mainly hockey and soccer).  When i’m not playing CSGO I enjoy playing some basketball with friends. Also I just got my drivers license so I have been spending a good bit of time driving. I’m planning on getting my pilots license within the next year also.	7-9 months	I think the sub has a pretty good community. Of course every community has it's bad apples but I think you guys do a pretty amazing job running the sub. Personally I do have an idea for the sub I think it would be cool if were had a free talk friday thread. (https://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/37qhkx/free_talk_friday_one_year_anniversary/?)
5/30/2015 18:12:32	http://reddit.com/u/Reizh	GMT-4	17	HTML, little CSS	Not CS:GO but SourceMod experience admining a TF2 server for a competitive team. The server was hosted by Multiplay	I would love to join but the times are a bit off for me!	I love them, really helps the community and is valuable for helping us expand the wiki! A lot of interesting reads too. 	I'm a Wiki contributor who spends far too much time on Reddit - basically every day. I'm in high school right now so I have a pretty standard schedule from 7:30 AM to 2 PM EST.   I'm a MG1 in CS:GO, spend too much time on that as well! In general, I just want to do as much as possible to help a subreddit dedicated to the game I like. Even if I don't get in, I'm still more than happy to keep on writing for the wiki!	4-6 months	At the start, I thought all reddit communities were pretty dumb to be honest but over time, I really enjoyed being with the /r/GlobalOffensive community. They're a real tight knit group in my opinion!
5/30/2015 18:16:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/Thefatheroftheabyss/	GMT+3	17	None	None	Community nights are a great way of interaction between the members of this subreddit, its a good idea that brings in people from all of the ranks  to play together and have fun plus to share ideas on different subject of this game .And its awesome to meet the people behind there reddit account.	Since Counter strike : Global offensive is seeing a huge spike in its players base, and more and more new players are joining ,Newbie thursday is a great way to share knowledge of the game with newcomers , and possibly answer any question a "Newbie" has to ask from the simplest one to the more complex ones by a more experienced player which will help facilitate a new player's'understanding of this game.	Hello my name is Jad,i play under the alias of Akula ingame, i come from a village located inside Lebanon.Where do i start? I started playing CS:GO during last summer and currently i'm at the "Legendary Eagle"rank , and i'm still enjoying every last bit of this game although my country isn't the best at offering the fastest internet nor the best equipments i manage myself on EU servers. If i was to be told to describe myself i would say ,i care more about others than myself (which has been causing issues irl :P) i like to be as polite as possible to people i meet, and the main reason i'm applying for this position is because i've always loved being part of a community and try and feel like i'm making a difference and helping other people out as i would like to always see what i love flourish and become something better than before.	7-9 months	/r/GlobalOffensive is a big mashup of different type of personalities and players.Ever since i started lurking this subreddit ,i've seen  many changes occure to improve the direction this subreddit was going towards . /r/globaloffensive have always felt like a cozy place where you actually enjoy knowing some people are discussing parts of this game, from new maps to Pro-matches etc.But ofcourse every community has to have the type of people that are somewhat annoying and disturbing but we always have our mods cleaning them up, although the  drama in this subreddit is abit overdone sometimes by most members to a tolerable point i always seem to comeback to read all the comments and different opnions of every player (which is really awesome) on every topic that shows up.So in the end this community is really a gem that should be taken care of carefully and it would be a shame to lose such a huge and amazing member base (except for the trolls, we don't like those ).
5/30/2015 18:20:04	http://www.reddit.com/user/JDilleen	GMT+0	23	Currently on a second internship at FireEye (a cyber security company) developing internal web applications used from California to Singapore. Experience includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript. jQuery, PHP, PostgreSQL and Linux server administration. In September I will be returning to my final year in university studying Computer Games Development where I have experience in Java, C, C++ programming and Android development.	No experience in hosting servers but am very interesting in learning. Will be testing out and hosting my own servers via my DigitalOcean account in the future.	Have never joined any community night, but would be interested in doing so.	Fantastic environment for newer players to ask questions that would generally be downvoted to oblivion.	Computer Games Development student about to go into his final year, currently a web developer at a cyber security company. Legendary Eagle in game (inb4 I don't get considered because I could bump Jpon out of the top 5 ranks for staff cups ;D) Huge Manchester United fan. Lover of all things technology. Irish (everyone seems to love the Irish). Usually active during the day (browsing occasionally at work) and evening times when I get home. Feel free to PM me on Reddit if there's any other questions :)  - James	7-9 months	I've been lurking for the best part of a year, I bought CSGO on its release day but didn't really start playing properly until last June/July at which time I subscribed to the subreddit. I've noticed the community become increasingly toxic, especially toward the Valve developers which seems unwarranted.  I believe there should be a rule to avoid any form of witch hunt (aka Flusha). This rule in particular seems ridiculous:  "Accusing someone of cheating or scamming is not allowed. ... Exceptions will be made if the accused is sufficiently famous within the CS:GO community or part of a well known organization and there is solid evidence to back your claims."  The subreddit gained a VERY negative reputation during the whole Flusha accusation period.
5/30/2015 18:27:34	http://www.reddit.com/user/pete2fiddy	GMT-4	16	Self-taught java, but I am by no means great at it.	Nope.	I've wanted to participate in one for a really long time, but never could.  Really cool idea, I'm sure I'll do one over the summer! I like the idea behind being able to meet certain people's reddit personas in-game, as well as the fact that you can meet new friends there as well. Not sure if map play-test sessions count as Community Nights, but those are super cool as well. Being able to help someone put out a polished final product is amazing; just feeling that you took part in it in a way, no matter how small, is awesome.	CS is such a difficult game to learn, I think these question threads are a great way for people to learn about basic game mechanics, as looking up tutorials can be daunting for some since they have no clue where to begin.   It's also a good way to teach more seasoned players new things, like explaining certain changes in the pro meta and why they occurred, or talking about weapon nerfs and buffs, along with their viability to be added into current play (like the new SMG buff).	I'm a sophomore in high school who will be graduating in a week. I played CS:GO for a bit two years ago, stopped, then started again a little more than a year ago. I'm a shy kid, but that all goes away on the internet or on reddit, and this sub has actually helped me a bunch in that regard; it allowed me to realize that people won't think of me poorly for expressing myself as who I am, which I am really thankful for.   Besides this, ever since I joined the sub, and especially once I had gotten very involved in it, I've always wanted to become a mod. To be some form of "figure" in a community that I've always like seemed amazing to me; and I feel like being in a position like that is the best way for me to better the community through my own efforts as well, which is even cooler.  Of course, the biggest issue that I assumed would hinder my ability to moderate wold be my age, 16, but I feel as though I am capable of offering similar help or services as people who are older than myself. I seem to fit every other criteria; god knows I comment a lot, although I'm sure I'll have to find a way to cut down on the crappy dad-jokes if I do manage to get mod...  Also, I promise I'll do more on the wiki after my exams are over!	10-12 months	Generally very nice and kind, with a select few who make troll accounts to degrade players or harass original posters.   People LOVE to help each other out. I was adopted by a german LE (now GE) many many months ago, and we are still good friends, and have played a few games together as well (figured the ping would balance out the fact that he had to smurf), and I've met a whole bunch of other friends on this sub as well.  I can't really comment too much on the mods, they seem to do a good job from what I've seen.
5/30/2015 18:30:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/Elwyn123/	GMT-5	15	I have experience coding for Javascript. However, it does not apply to websites, only programs compiled using applications such as Eclipse or NetBeans.	I do not have experience in admining CSGO servers.	While I have not personally taken part in the past (thought that may change now that I am more confident in my abilities), I think that Community Night is a great idea. It allows for people to play with others from the subreddit, as well as a platform for improvement. In general, it is a lot more fun playing with people who have something in common than randoms in Valve's matchmaking.  In these games, players are often kinder, more understanding, and less prone to abandoning, team killing, general salt, etc. Unlike a normal matchmaking game, Community Night emphasizes just that - the /r/GlobalOffensive community. Although it may not seem so obvious at first, but having something in common - even if it is such a popular subreddit - tends to dissuade people from being cruel or mean. There is a lot to be learned and a lot of fun to be had. Personally, I would enjoy it if these were made even more common - although I have no idea as to whether or not that would be possible.	Personally, I believe it to be an incredibly important part of the community.  There are many players, or prospective players, of CSGO that are intimidated by the skill levels of others on the subreddit. Often, both in game and out of the game, these players are mocked for their lack of skill. I personally went through this when I was in silver. At the time, I had no clue what to do - and the circle of "friends" that had brought me into the game constantly mocked my lack of skill and - save for one notable exception - refused to help me, even going so far as to give me misleading advice.  I had just about given up when I found /r/globaloffensive a few months ago, and I spent a long time going through "Newbie Thursday" posts and reading about what I could do to fix my gameplay.  I am hardly a stellar player, but I can hold my own at MG1, which is a massive leap from Silver 4. And I can certainly say that Newbie Thursday (coupled with one of my friend's help and some videos) is responsible for about 90% of that.  If it wasn't clear from above, I am all for Newbie Thursdays, as they provide a crucial crutch for new players such as I was that would otherwise be discouraged from playing due to the nature of the CS community.	I am a highschool student. I can't quite think of a way to prove my maturity through this form, but I assure whoever may be reading this that I try my best to be calm, measured, and reasoned.  I do not post or comment out of anger, nor do I delete posts that go against my personal views. And despite occasional hiccups, I adhere to redditquette as closely as possible (I do occasionally downvote based on opinion, as many of us do).  I do moderate a few subreddits, but most of these are personal interests. Only one subreddit, /r/CreativeRoom, is moderately active. I do my best to police that sub when I can, although posts do not come more often than one a day so it is not too difficult.  As a bored student who often has to stay at home, I have a lot of time to commit to helping out with moderation. At least in the short term, with summer vacation in less than a month, I will have several hours a day, if not more, when I am free and will likely moderate the subreddit as I browse the internet or talk to friends.	0-3 months	Personally I think that the GlobalOffensive community is rather similar to most other subreddits. Toxic, unhelpful comments are most often deleted, and good, helpful ones are upvoted.  While many would complain about recent 'shitposts', I do not believe that this is in anyway harmful to the community. /r/GlobalOffensive is not exclusively for serious discussion; as with any subreddit about a topic a broad range of material is invited. The rise of pun posts, jokes, fake "callout maps", and the like are good things in my eyes, because they represent how active and eager the subreddit's community is to contribute something funny or relevant. There is a line to be drawn, as with all things, but until such posts drown out other ones or become a nuisance, they belong.  I also believe that the current moderators are doing a pretty good job. I do not see many rule-breaking posts at all, and even the ones that I do see are often promptly deleted.  There are many more obscure rules, or ones that are not immediately self-evident, that may not be so tightly enforced. For example, the rules against reporting scamming methods. Well-meaning people could post these, and a moderator that is not so vigilant may accidentally let it pass.   However, I have not personally seen any such incident. From what I can see, the current moderators are doing an admirable job. I also assume (although I cannot know for sure) that no genuine posts were removed by the moderators.  No matter what you think about my application, I have to encourage who ever is reading this to be very, very careful with selection. One bad moderator can ruin /r/GlobalOffensive's reputation, which is already in the spotlight after the debacle over at /r/LeageofLegends.  I love the CSGO community (the one in the subreddit, not the actual game such as in matchmaking *shivers*). I love how it encourages discussion, enables change in the community, and brings attention to the game as a whole. At the same time, it is also a place to read and see more "fluff" about the game and have a good laugh. It avoids the pitfalls of other big subreddits by encouraging and moderating both kinds of submissions. /r/GlobalOffensive is not purely for serious discussion, nor has it been turned into a purely fluff/shitpost subreddit. It is definitely something that other large subreddits about video games should strive to be like. I'd love to play a part in making it all happen.

I don't really have much hands-on programming experience to be very useful, but I'm looking forward to doing stuff if possible	No, but I have wanted to for a long time.	Most of it is in EU, so I can't really participate given that I am in NA.	I find those threads to be very helpful at, and I'd rather not make a thread myself so it is quite convenient.	I hate the Twitch chat of Csgo. I usually go on /r/globaloffensive and read a page or two of threads everyday either on my computer or my phone. That is all.	4-6 months	I like it, but sometimes I'm afraid to comment because some topics might be very controversial and I'd rather not get downvoted into the ground.
5/30/2015 18:37:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/Serunder	GMT-4	15	No	No	I like it. I wish I could attend more but for some reason I never show up.	Good for new players and members of the sub reddit. Helped me out a lot when I first started.	My name is Michael, I'm a 15 year old in Toronto, I've been playing CS GO for 2 years now, played source for about an hour and got tired of it. I'm good in math and science, and that's really all there is.	4-6 months	The community is lovely, a little overly opinionated but it's the internet. I feel the community has changed over time as there has been a great influx of new players which would mean a new demographic and audience. I do not really notice these changes as they have happened seamlessly.
5/30/2015 18:37:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/CoolBlackGuy7/	GMT+10	16	Some HTML, currently learning Python	No experience with admining CS servers	Never payed much attention to it.	Pretty good thread lots of relevant stuff.	Im 16 years old living in Queensland, Australia. I go to school and do maths and science subjects and I want to go to university to become an engineer. I have been playing video games since I was about 5 or 6 and started at PC gaming as my dad owns a computer shop. I played 1.6 for about a year or two then I played source until I was about 9 when I got an xbox and stopped playing PC. When I was 14 I came back to PC gaming starting with Dota 2 and about a year later CS:GO. I devote around 30 hours a week to gaming but I need to keep on top of my studies and go to my part time job so sometimes I have to play less.	10-12 months	Overall a pretty good sub not much flaming happening, only bad thing is people downvote just because they disagree with someone. Current mods are good, would be nice if they got involved a little more though.
5/30/2015 18:47:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/never_cleaned_comp	GMT+1	22	Some, but not enough to contribute to the coding aspect at all :)	Not with any hosting aspects, but I have been admin on several servers, mostly in 1.6.  Johnny-Server was a decent sized network of servers that I used to admin with several other guys - It's fun and rewarding to see a community grow, while helping keeping it clean.	I think it's cool! Unfortunately, I haven't been a part of any myself, but I'd like to in the future.  It helps to grow the community, as well as keeping it more tight, in a sense.	It's awesome. I always check them, and I have answered a few questions, but I see them pretty late, most of the time - People are really fast with answering, which is good!	22 year old student from Denmark. Played cs since late 1.5, used to be really competitive, but only on a national level. Huge fan of any kind of eSports. These days it's cs and fighting games, but I also used to watch a lot of Starcraft.  I was part of the modding and event team for GameReplays.org many years ago, which gave a lot of nice experiences - I love working with a dedicated team, and the internal discussions are cool, when they lead to a better product for the community.  Mostly I just want to contribute to the community in a nice way. Keeping the sub tidy is a big factor, but I'd also like to be a part of developing new events for the community, like Newbie Thursday, Community Night, etc.  I have a lot of free time now, as I'm on summervacation, which is spend mostly on reddit anyway, so I might as well do something productive with the time :)  Hope to hear from you!  Louis.	13-18 months	Never had any problems with the mods - the community is cool, albeit a bit 'whiny' but I guess that's to be expected. The hate on Valve is something I cannot get behind, but I mostly avoid the discussions, as they normally lead nowhere.  On that note, it's an opinion that needs to be respected, like any other.w
5/30/2015 18:41:20	http://reddit.com/u/TheGenericBanana	GMT-4	16	I was learning how to program a year ago or so, but school got in the way. Next year I'm going to a much easier school, so I'm planning on learning how to program websites and such.	I do not, but I'm willing to learn.	I've been to many community nights, and I like them. The experiences have all been good, other than a few DMGs that put their ranks as S1. The idea of practicing maps is cool, but sometimes the maps are so bad (I don't remember the name, but there was one where A site was full of clipping errors in plants that made you not be able to move well, and the other site had Ts get there before CTs, not to mention the random green graphics error wall everyone was experiencing outside T spawn). The best thing about it is that S1 and GEs can play, and the teams usually still end up somewhat balanced IMO, so it's fun.	I don't participate much in these, I've answered questions on it a few times IIRC and generally check out the top comments, but usually my way of helping "noobs" is to go on /r/adoptasilver and teach them some stuff, mostly economy game sense, crosshair placement and how to AWP.	I'm a 16 year old guy who lived in Argentina for 11 years, and moved back to my birthplace of New York in 2013. I speak 100% fluent English and Spanish, some French, and dream of being a polyglot someday. Regarding CS, I've been playing GO and frequenting the subreddit for a few years now, and am currently around LEM. I know all of the rules of reddit and the subreddit, and follow them, and could work on moderation for many hours a day, considering I'll be pretty free for the next few years. Usually when I post it's congratulating someone on their cake day or nice play, trying to contribute to a discussion, etc. I live in New York, and have that timezone, but generally am awake and free very often, so I don't think the timezone matters that much. I've moderated in a few forums before, and like doing it. If I were given the moderating position, I'd try my best to represent the subreddit well and work as a team. :)	19-24 months	I've been active on /r/globaloffensive for a long time, and it's by far my favorite subreddit. I go there for news on the pro scene, updates (shoutout to /u/wickedplayer494), discussions, etc. I don't like how much fluff is on there (like the Jesus spotted on de_resort post currently on the frontpage), but generally it's a cool place. Honestly I don't have anything to criticize regarding the moderation, you seem to be doing a good job, at least while I'm awake and on the subreddit.

5/30/2015 18:44:39	http://reddit.com/u/TehStuzz	GMT+1	18	I have some Python experience, but to be honest I'm not that well versed in it. Some projects I created include a small Reddit bot using PRAW and a progression tracker for an MMO I used to play. 	I have no experience with CS:GO hosting. I did however run a Minecraft server with up to 60+ players concurrently for over two years from a dedicated box, so I am somewhat versed in basic server management on several Linux distro's. After running the community for two years I decided that I didn't have the motivation to do so anymore and handed it over to my head-admin. In case you are interested in seeing it, the server (though much less active) still exists and the website can be found at stuzzcraft.org.	I've taken part in a couple of EU community nights and it has always been great fun. Community Nights are a great way for the Global Offensive community to get together and enjoy the game we spend so much time talking about. I've met some people during the Community Nights that I still play with regularly today. Apart from the occasional server with network issues the experience as a player has always been very smooth, and I don't think it's necessary to try and make major changes or anything to it.	I haven't really participated in any Newbie Thursday threads and thus don't have any specific thoughts on it. The idea is great in my opinion though.	Heya! I'm TehStuzz, or Wessel to friends. I'm 18 years old and I was born and raised in the Netherlands. Although English is not my native language, I consider myself fairly good in it as a result of being exposed to it from a young age. I just finished my finals and will hear the results in a few weeks, if all goes well I'll be starting my Computer Science degree at the university level later this year!  I've been playing Counterstrike for about eight months now and since then many of my friends have started playing the game as well. When I'm not playing CS, you can find me watching movies or series (currently watching American Horror Story), hanging out with friends or working my vacation job.  	7-9 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive is a very outspoken community. They will easy vilify someone for their actions even when there is little evidence (see: Flusha's lifting). When not handled carefully, discussions can easily spiral out of control and turn into witch-hunts. Though being outspoken is not necessarily a bad thing, the community will also praise members for their contributions when they are deemed great. During my time using visiting this subreddit I can't say that the community has changed all that much. Perhaps the quality has gone down slightly due to the large influx of new members, but for a subreddit of this size, /r/GlobalOffensive certainly has one of the best communities out there. 
5/30/2015 18:48:25	http://www.reddit.com/user/097aceofspades	GMT-6	16	I've taken a class in java and html.	I was a moderator for a minecraft server called DreamCraft 4ish years ago. 	I've only participated in community night once, and it was pretty fun.	Newbie thursday is probably one of the best things I've seen on the subreddit. I love browsing through it to learn/teach players. 	I'm not exactly sure what to write about myself here, but here goes nothing.  I'm 16, I live with my single mom and 2 sisters, I'm currently a student in high school with average grades. My 2 passions in life are Gaming, and A/V production. I've been playing games since I was 3 years old. My favorite games are Counter Strike, Portal 2, and Super Mario World. 	4-6 months	Most people are friendly in this community. There are a few bad apples, but not enough to really effect the community in a negative way.
5/30/2015 18:48:52	http://www.reddit.com/user/DanBergundy/	GMT-5	30	Yes, I am a highly successful front-end web developer that has  done highly complex work for many of the largest companies in the world.  https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=60764063	Yes, I have my own headshot only server and teamspeak  running on my own digital ocean server setup with terminal. 	I havent had a chance to participate in any events on the subreddit but would love to get involved. 	Again, I haven't been involved. Love the idea though. 	I am a 30 year old web developer from the Minneapolis area. I have a degree in graphic design. I am married with 3 children. I work from home so I am always online. I an extremely active on Twitch. I am a moderator for some large streamers like Summit1g. I also moderate his subreddit. I have done a lot of web, design, and irc scripting work for the community, streamers, etc.	10-12 months	This is THE place to go for news, info, strategies, humor, etc. 
5/30/2015 18:50:21	http://reddit.com/user/link5505	GMT-5	14	HTML, I know the essentials.	no	no thoughts	keep up the good job :)	I am a bilingual student, and I have played CSGO for about one year. I contribute to the community often. (ex:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN-ytRcq0vA) I'm not very good at writing bios.	7-9 months	there are too many duplicate suggestion threads. (like the same idea posted every week)
5/30/2015 18:54:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/NightGore/	GMT+3	16	Nope, Sorry :\ (by the way, everything I tried to fill in on the timezone section it wouldn't accept. I live in Vancouver, Canada. PDT Time Zone +1)	Yes! A big one I can think of is for about 2 years I have been a Moderator on the Minecraft server BeastsMC (http://www.beastsmc.com/). It is a big network of different servers, as well as a registered company, so Its pretty cool. We do get the occasional dickheads who just want to watch the world burn, but for the most part, its is a quite stable community.	Really cool! I think it is a really good way to make the community come together and have some fun. Though I have never participated in any, but I would like to soon!	Probably one of my favourite things on the subreddit to be honest. If you are either Silver or Global Elite, it gives anybody the chance to ask a question that they want about CS:GO without being majorly judged, which would probably happen anywhere else on the Internet. A really cool feature!	I'm a 16 year old kid from Vancouver, Canada. No we don't ride on polar bears, no its not always snowing, and no everybody doesn't play hockey and say eh all the time :P My two main games I play are CS:GO and Dota 2. Last year I went and watched the Dota world championships in Seattle, so that was really cool! I feel like I get emotional to easily. I'm the Computer nerd of my school, If a class is having a problem, sometimes teachers will come find me in another class, and I will go down to their class to help them with Software or Hardware computer stuff. I'm quite good and experienced with computer hardware and software. My next thing I want to learn about computers is some sort of coding, Since I think I know a lot about everything else software related. In my life I have built 2 of my own computers by myself, that was fun! I enjoy Doctor Who, Sherlock, Agents of Shield, absolutely anything Marvel. tl;dr: I'm a nerd of all sorts, and I'm proud of it :)	7-9 months	To be honest, 85-90% of the community is really good. I don't see to many mean people, mostly just some people that have the same passion for Counter-Strike enjoying it together. Not much I can think of, just some really cool people.
5/30/2015 19:04:53	http://reddit.com/u/ZezurgeMC	GMT-5	15	JavaScript, Python	Not CS:GO. But I used to love Minecraft (Please don't allow this to impact whether I am to be or not to be a mod.) and I owned a server for about 2 months and pulled in around $600, not much, but ok for about ~30 hours of work, also having fun doing so though. Also I have admined probably about 5-10 other Minecraft servers, I enjoyed the responsibility, and the pay of course :) But I love CSGO, and wasting money on it, so not being payed for modding this wouldn't bother me.	Community is fun, but needs to be moderated more, there are too many troll posts in my opinion, which needs to be removed. But in the end, it's a fun experience.	Eh, so so, I feel like actual new players aren't going to be on this subreddit too often. But if they are, then yeah it's definitely helpful!	My name is Jared, I'm 15 years old, and live in Vermont USA. My life is baseball and CS:GO. I have a small YouTube channel (about 2,000 subscribers.) that I used to giveaway skins on but I have recently slowed down doing so. I live with a family of 6, my mom, dad, my brothers, Reed and Chase, and my sister Bianca, I am the youngest of the lot. That's about it.	7-9 months	It's good overall. Good amount of good people. Good posts. Good looking. So yeah it's great. I honestly probably sound like I'm kissing ass, but really I love the community.
5/30/2015 19:06:50	http://www.reddit.com/user/CheesyHotDogPuff/	GMT-6	15	N/A, other than some basic Python.	Was a moderator on a now defunct minecraft server that had around 45 people on at a time, mineopoly.de.	A great way to give feedback to map makers.	Great for people of all skill levels to ask a question. My favorite sticky thread.	15, live in Western Canada. Been playing FPS games for 5 years, picked up counter strike last summer, and I love it. I enjoy mountain biking, discus, skiing, and long distance running in real life. I love playing PC games in my free time, but I prefer first person shooters. 	7-9 months	A great, friendly community. Much more friendly than ESEA for hltv. We tend to have a bit of a hivemind, for better or for worst. The subreddit has helped me improve at counter strike a lot.
5/30/2015 19:08:21	https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghostiieee/	GMT+0	25	Unfortunately, no. Although I am pretty open to learn, I have tried few times and only succeed in having my brain exploded. 	I have experience in both moderating a forum (Which died down now, unfortunately) and their servers a while back called DumB. Admins would be called on if there was anyone hacking, abusing the rules or the arguments breaking out. But in any official servers such as Faceit, CEVO and etc, I haven't no. 	I thought they are fantastic, a great way to get the community together in a way. 	A good way to ease in newbie who are new but hesitating and have a lot of questions. I havent been on it personally. 	I am 25, nearly 26. I work as a senior editor and I live in England. I have played CS franchise ever since CS:S orangebox update was introduced which is around 6 years ago I think and I havent stopped playing since then. It's probably wise to add that I am deaf and I couldnt be able to use Teamspeak or any of similar feature due to me not able to hear. If that's the issue, then no problem at all. I tend to lurk the sub reddit instead of posting/commenting.   I also have been active in NA Revival for CSGO back then and was a volunteer to be the mod of the Twitch channel for a while when there was unexpected surge of people talking on the channel.   Thanks for letting me to have the chance :) 	4-6 months	It could be improved, in my opinion but it's just the community instead of the content. Often we would see, using recent events as example, we would see a lot of people posting a lot about ESEA to the point where it could get old very quickly but again, nothing mods could do. It's more of the community. 
5/30/2015 19:12:11	http://www.reddit.com/user/sidipi/	UTC-8	25	I have a good amount of experience in coding especially my major being Computer Science.   I mostly work on backend systems development (based on Linux and Java) but I am familiar with PHP, Python, RegEx and a bit of NodeJS.	Yes. I host my own server for our team practices. It is hosted on a Linux VM on Amazon EC2 cloud.  We (my team) often use it to practice and go over smokes and nade spots to prepare for weekly games.  It is not so powerful enough to host community servers yet. I plan to host a community KZ server when I get access to a powerful server. I actually hosted my server just out of curiosity and my interest in the game and I ended up using that server for my team.	I think community nights are important to check out new maps and playtest them. It provides different perspectives of varying players which is useful as a feedback.  However, unfortunately I have never been able to be a part of any due to either time constraints or team practice.	Newbie Thursdays are one of the better things of this subreddit. I believe the thread should be such that players can ask even the silliest of their questions without feeling embarrassed and I am glad that it is exactly like that. I try and help out as much as I can with the questions which I think I am capable to answer.  Also it is a brilliant pool of abundant knowledge about the game. The best thing is that every Thursday it grows even larger!	I am a CS enthusiast who started this game 15 months ago and in the 2162 hours of CS:GO played so far I enjoyed every minute of it. I used to play 1.6 but that was just casually. I take CS:GO seriously and I am always willing to improve. Luckily I have 4 other people with the same goals who I have teamed up with! My first rank was Silver 4 and I have reached up to LE so far :D hopefully more to follow!  I like playing the KZ mod because it is challenging apart from the perk that it makes you look fancy when you pull some jumps off in an actual competitive game. I also play on a lot of retake servers. I spend a good amount of time figuring out smokes and strats by just being in a server or watching demos.  I like to watch pro games especially NA games and I try to catch games of Liquid, LG and C9. I am also a big Twitch fan. I mod a few of the channels that I support like adreN. I am pretty much online (just like ChrisJ Kappa) all the time and browsing through the subreddit and I am surprised how much I still learn from it everyday.  The /r/GlobalOffensive community had a pretty huge impact on how my skills improved and how my interest in this field has grown and I will always be grateful. I am actually glad that I found this community and I wish I had found it sooner. I always try to help out by answering some questions in the best possible manner. If I get a chance to mod I will try my best to help this growing community.  Some help that I provided to the community: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/311d44/sound_bug_report_after_33115_update_running_sound/ And some on quora too! http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-started-following-the-Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive-pro-scene/answer/Siddharth-Bhave  My Steam profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/SidiPi/  Please feel free to ask me anything and let me know if you need any other info.  Thanks, SidiPi	7-9 months	I personally like the community. 80% of the people are sensible. There obviously some folks who make derogatory remarks which are baseless.  Good posts are appreciated and bad ones are sometimes bashed too much. Its a "community" so we come across a lot of different type of people. The past few weeks I have seen a lot of newbie questions that maybe because of the influx of newer players in the game.  Some fluff and fun posts are hilarious. The comments on them like the cherry on the icing! These kinds of posts lighten the mood of the subreddit that is always cursing Valve to fix things. But seriously "Volvo, Fix plz"
5/30/2015 19:23:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/trenton_jeffro/	GMT-5	16	Yes, Java HTML, and dabbled with Javascript(not much)	No never any CSGO server admining.	None	I think it is great helping newer members of the community progress	I am 16 years old, born Nov. 28, 98. Currently homeschooled, do some smalltime programming for people. Love playing CSGO, watching streams, and doing other gaming related activities!	4-6 months	The community is good, but there are a few toxic members.
5/30/2015 19:24:37	https://www.reddit.com/user/aiiX23/	GMT+2	20	No, but I have some free time right now, so I could get into that.	No, but as I said in my last Answer, I have some free time right now.	I think they are a great Idea in theory, I never joined one yet, but I want to.	It's a great thing in my opinion, helping others and improving their game makes it more fun for everyone.	Hello there. My name is Tobias, I'm from germany and I played Counter-Strike back in version 1.5 and love the game/series since.  Now many Years have passed and here I am more than 11 Years later. I'm a pretty regular guy, I live in a kind of small town ~25k People and I startet my training as an IT guy, after that I startet a training as a chef, but I could do any of those for a long time since I have an illnes. It's not really a "big" one but I have/had some problems with accepting it for myself. Now I'm at a state where I really want to do things, especially because I lost someone important a few days ago. So what could be better than helping out the community that formed me and my childhood.  Now there will be a wall of text about my CS/gaming career. You don't need to read that, I just felt like I sould write it down just in case.  After the 1.6 days I had a break for some years (around 6 I think) shortly after CS:S was released. I just had no fun with CS:S after a long period of 1.5 and 1.6 and I slipped into games like WoW and LoL. When I first heard about CS:GO (I think it was in the middle of 2011) I was pretty hyped. I always felt like I have to go back to my "true love" that was CS and with CS:GO It felt like the right time(2012). Shortly after CS:GO launched I stopped playing because It didn't felt "right" and I had to study more for school ;). A good year later I heard some news about NIP Gaming dominating the everyone so I got into some Twitch.tv streams where I found some great casting and I got really into CS again. After I watched NIP losing vs Verygames back in 2013 in the EMS Raidcall Finals and breaking their losing streak against NIP I was really hyped again. The first Major came up, DHW 2013, after that I was hooked completely.	19-24 months	I really feel like the r/GO community has evolved great. You can have great discussions about current meta or patch changes but there is also always room for enjoying great plays or funny moments in the game we all love.  You have a hard time finding troll threads and if you spot one it's most likely gone before you can click on it.
5/30/2015 19:25:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/c4bb0ose/	GMT+12	23	HTML, CSS, javascript, JSON, mySQL, php (I have a computer sceince degree so we coverd a whole range of coding languages.)	No	It's a nice idea but since I am located in NZ it is generally not possible for me to participate.	It is a good idea, not everyone has the foresight to search for their questions before they post and newer players find it less intimidating posting in a thread, rather than making their own post.	I started to play CSGO right when it came out, I took a break to focus on my studies towards a computer science degree and came back once they introduced skins.  I am currently studying again and I am focusing this time on psychology as I realized that although the world is run by electronics and computers psychology plays the same if not bigger part compared with computers.  I am however only studying for this year and I would like some form of employment after this years studies are done :P  	19-24 months	The community itself often bandwagons on issues that in reality should not really be getting that much attention. For example right now there is a big thread on how the tec-9 is overpowered, but for most people commenting they are pointing out this is not the case at all. 
5/30/2015 19:26:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/ZionTheKing/	GMT+1	19	I've been doing C# and C++ as a hobby for about 4 years, and I've been freelancing and working on paid projects for about 1 year. I also do Web development, although only been doing that for about 2 years, and not as actively. 	I've never been a server admin.	I think it's really fun. I've participated three times, and it's a great way to test the maps. The maps are usually not super viable all the time, but we still have fun so. I'd like to see the community nights continue.	Nothing to say here really. Although I like to teach people play better, so I'm all for it.	I'm a hobby programmer (also make some money from it), and a long time gamer. I've been playing CS and WoW since forever, and I've never really played any other games. I hated CSS, so I stuck with 1.6 until half a year or so after csgo was released, then I switched to csgo.  I like the current state of the game, and even if it has some issues people complain way too much.  I've been a moderator for four years on a MapleStory forum with 30k members. I've also moderated chan boards actively.  I'm a pretty calm dude with a thick skin, and I tolerate no bullshit. I've never been ban-happy, but rather try to solve problems in ways where everyone are happy.  I like all kinds of music, I hate MAC pcs but I like the iOS phone UI. I hate Chrome browser but I still use it. I pay for Spotify every month but I hardly listen to it, but I might do at some point.  So yeah, that's me. :)	19-24 months	Honestly, a large part can be very childish and biased, and anything that doesn't match their opinion will get down voted. This isn't something that is limited to /r/csgo of course - it's just how Reddit is, sadly. I try to do my part and upvote the controversial posts so everyone gets a say. (That sounded cheesy, but whatever).  But honestly, there's a large part of the community on here with common sense and that just wants to enjoy the game, and I respect them a lot.  I can't really criticize the mods in any way. I think the sub is ran really nicely, and form my seat it doesn't look like you'd need more mods, but I figured I'd apply since you needed more, and I'd like to help and do my part since I'm on this subreddit quite a lot.
5/30/2015 19:28:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/Chewbacker/	GMT+1	20	No.	No.	Community night is a great idea, but it could be much bigger, in my opinion. I see it posted on the subreddit often, but I think there could be a few better ways to advertise it and increase its popularity among users.	To be honest, I was well practised as CSGO before I came to the sub, so I haven't checked it out. But it is a good idea to help newer players get into the game and get some advice from others that have been playing CS for years.	Not quite sure what to say, but I'll give it a shot!  My name is /u/chewbacker. I am 20 years old and studying Game Design at University in England.  I have been playing CS since about 2006 and picked up CSGO about a year and a half ago which has since blown up.  I studied Graphic Design for two years, so I still have quite a large passion for everything in that area. I even made a banner for you guys, which you ended up chosing :) Thank you, by the way. Since I studied for it for 2 years I became very familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator which I am still using on my current course. And thanks to my current course, I am also decent with 3DS Max. So if you guys needed anything in that area, I hope I could help you out.  My first year of University has just finished, so I have the whole summer ahead of me to fill with something to do.	10-12 months	I started using this sub around August/September last year and since then the CSGO scene has increased to an incredibly large number, and in turn, so has this sub. In that time the sub seems to have attracted quite a large number of toxic users, which is quite sad, but I'm sure that is something than can either be fixed or it will fade away over time.  I've got into playing Dota 2 recently, so I checked out their sub which I expected to be filled with League of Legend-esque players, but it turns out 95% of them are incredibly friendly and welcoming to old and new users. My hopes is that /r/globaloffensive could turn into that at some point, which will hopefully make it much more pleasant than it is now.
5/30/2015 19:30:50	https://www.reddit.com/user/Tip-/	GMT-7	15	Nope, but I can learn it if required.	I admin my own practice server for my CEVO-Free team, which is hosted trough a third party and configured by me. I do have admining experience in other FPS titles, mainly ArmA and DayZ.	Although I haven't had the time to participate in one myself, I've heard it's a generally fun experience and it's good for play testing maps.	It was a vital point of me growing as a newer CS player. This sub helping newer players is beneficial for CS:GO's growth.	Hey mods! I'm Jackson. I've been playing CS since I was 11, and recently developed a passion for it and have played the game since beta. After running many Arma/DayZ communities, I eventually decided to step down from that hobby and explore CS a bit more. I liked what I found, and stuck with it. I currently captain/manage a CEVO-Free team and enjoy helping newer players learn the game. I have 800 hours total in CS:GO on two accounts and have experience with the CEVO/ESEA/FACEIT clients.  In terms of my personal life, I'm a high-schooler in the US. I play rugby, run cross country, and am a member of my school's student council. Although I am busy during the school year, I always have time for gaming and love managing things. This summer I have tons of free time, as I only work a part time job. I am a strong leader and not too opinionated/stubborn. I can enforce rules well and won't let power go to my head.   Anyways, thank you for reading this, and I hope you guys find the people you're looking for.	10-12 months	/r/GlobalOffensive is a bright beacon in the CS community. It's an interesting subreddit to browse and doesn't include a lot of the senseless drama that many other e-sports related subs see. The community isn't noticeably toxic, typically has a great sense of humor, and isn't always serious. I've noticed that this sub is an appropriate place for both objective and humorous talk; which provides a great balance. I would like to see the mods communicate with the subreddit a bit more though.
5/30/2015 19:33:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/laihonyin	UTC+0	16	Unfortunately not.	Nope. Unfortunately, I haven't had any experience in being admins of CS servers.	Community nights are great for bringing the community together and trying out new maps. Playing with other Reddit users is a great idea in having an opportunity to play better games with people who are more interested in having fun together. Especially for EU players, where you can play with English speaking users on the same team and have good communications through the reddit's mumble.	Newbie Thursday is good for newer players who have any questions regarding the game. Having one big thread where they can ask questions reduces the amount of new threads that are created. Also, it allows for the more experienced players to be gathered in one place where they can easily answer questions.	I'm 16 years old and from UK and play CS on a daily basis. I'm currently MGE/DMG level but mainly play Face-It. I have played CS for nearly a year and play with my irl friends. I'm finishing my last year of school and will be going to college next year. I'm a big football fan (Soccer for you 'Muricans) and enjoy playing sports with my friends too. Thanks fro reading guys. ;)	7-9 months	In my opinion, I think there are too many fluff posts. The trends of 'players when they are younger' or 'isometric illustrations' are really annoying in how many posts are created from them. When things like these are created they should all be directed to one thread, instead of having multiple pages on the front page filled with these fluff posts. I'd also like to see more match discussions within the subreddit. The post match discussions are really good and can be really insightful and fun to read. 
5/30/2015 19:35:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/pvpjack	GMT+0	19	No.	Yes, I used to be a Tester/Moderator in game and on the forum of a different game I played, this forum was dedicated across the whole server with 1000+ members, so it was pretty active. I assisted in general moderation, removing spam, warning people flaming, removing prohibited content.	I haven't yet participated in a Community Night due to my shift patterns in work have never gave me the opportunity, but the majority of my time in work is browsing the subreddit (I work in a very quiet IT Support desk) so I although majority of the time I'm lurking I'm still checking a lot of the sub reddits contents.	I believe we should encourage newbie Thursdays even more and try and get more advanced players involved.	Currently I'm 19 years old, living alone and spending a lot of my time either on the GlobalOffensive subreddit or in game playing CSGO. I do dabble in a few other games, Heroes of the Storm. Although I take that as a breather game to get away from the competitive side of CSGO and give meself a break.  I live in Liverpool, England and I have a career in IT Support for a market leader of a virtualization company. I am looking to give something back to the GlobalOffensive subreddit as it has already gave so much to me. I don't doubt there are going to be a lot of candidates and I'm submitting this and not really expecting a reply. Although as I previously enjoyed moderating and I spend a lot of time on this subreddit I thought I would give it a shot.  Hope to see you guys soon,  Jack.	19-24 months	To be honest, It's very easy to get roped into an argument with a simple minded browser, there seems to be a lot of trolls going unpunished and people generally acting like children/idiots. I myself have been involved in a few heated discussions due to people blatantly trolling hence why I have took more of a lurker role as recent. I would much rather read others opinions and discussions than get involved and provoked/trolled.
5/30/2015 19:37:46	https://www.reddit.com/user/Aeliann	GMT-4	19	I have experience recognizing coding syntax for PHP, HTML and Slight Java. I don't have much experience with coding but I do work on some lua coding for a Garrysmod server.	I don't have any experience with CS:GO server administrating but I do currently own a Garrysmod Community with a friend. We have several servers and have been doing it for around 3 years. We run them on a VDS and actually have one CS:GO server strictly for fun use, nothing serious. We just hop on it to play with friends on any game mode we chose. 		I think Newbie Thursday is a great way for new members to the Reddit to get involved. It allows them to seek answers for questions and allows the more experienced Redditors in Global Offensive to give them the answers to their questions. It also points them in the right direction to the other Subreddits CS:GO related. All in all I think it is really useful.	My name is Matt, I'm currently a College student for Chemical Production & Power Engineering. It's a 3 year course that I hope to be finishing in the next 2 years. I like to think I have really good people skills and am outgoing and mature. I can get along with almost anyone. I have a very energetic personality and try to do the best I can with anything I do. I'm currently on summer break and I have lots of spare time to browse the Subreddit and I feel like I wan't to try and take it a step further and really help out this community in the best ways I possibly can. Thank you very much for your consideration.	4-6 months	I think the community as a group is amazing. There are great constructive people involved to help grow CS:GO for the better. Everything from the people showing off their work whether it be maps, gun skins, suggestions. But with every community comes the people who aren't so amazing. The people who complain, whine and act childish and immature towards other users.
5/30/2015 19:38:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/jdawgisyodaddy/	UTC-4	20	I had a very brief introduction into HTML and using dreamweaver to create simple webpages as part of an introductory coding course. 	I helped run a server years ago for Star Wars Battlefront I. I was responsible for using the server to ensure quality and I handled numerous complaints and conflicts between players. 	I think community night is a fantastic way for r/GO users to interact with each other while helping out map creators in finding the good and bad of their maps. The 10 mans are a great way to improve game skill as well as find people that work well with your own playstyle to better understand your role. 	Newbie Thursday is the best way to answer questions from newer players on how the game works. Since Counter Strike is growing so quickly, recently surpassing DOTA 2 in player count, I think supporting new players and helping them get a head start towards improvement is a great service. There are a lot of mechanics that are very exclusive to the Counter Strike series that are not in other popular shooters such as Call of Duty or Battlefield so not many skills transfer to new players.	I am a 20 year old college student home for summer vacation. I am studying Engineering and Business at a university in New York State. I have time each day between classes and at night to browse the internet and play Counter Strike.  I am currently in a fraternity at my university so my weekend late evening availability during the school year is limited and I will be working over the summer which could limit day-time availability.   I fell in love with the game of Counter Strike and I would love to help the community in any way that I can!  Thank you for this opportunity,  -jdawgisyodaddy (JJTheJetPlane) 	10-12 months	I started using the subreddit around the same time I started playing Global Offensive. Of course I found it by typing in 'reddit.com/r/csgo" only to find that it redirected me to "r/GlobalOffensive". When I first started browsing, most of the content was question based and there were a lot of posts reminding users about pro streams and matches that were coming up. I loved the match discussion threads and all they hype that these posts created. (Being from NA, hype is all we really have to cling to :p). Currently, there is a lot of user-generated content every day for education and entertainment purposes which I think is great. I love seeing people's passion for the game whether it be through match analysis or through comics starring "Kevin" the derpy, tec-9 wielding terrorist.   I am also a big fan of the Reddit Cup. I think having a subreddit tournament is an awesome idea. It is something that could develop into a completely subreddit-run event with streams and casting just for fun or for actual prizes (or both!). 
5/30/2015 19:39:52	http://reddit.com/u/Bloated_Butthole	GMT-6	15	Some experience in HTML. I'm also in the process of learning Lua, but I have a fair amount of knowledge with it.	Plenty, especially in most source games. They were not very large communities, especially some of them have been hosted by myself. I think I'm pretty experienced with Administration on any platform.	No thoughts, really.	I've actually learned a lot, myself on some Newbie Thursdays! I really think they're a great opportunity for some people who are newer to the game and would like a chance to learn something.	I live in North Dakota at the moment, and have been playing Counter-Strike games for a large majority of my life. The game I've played most in the CS series is CS:S with 2,017 hours (http://gyazo.com/0f1ff73e9057b5ea9ee5da4b82a7321a). One of my favorite released games of all time for PC is definitely Garry's Mod, with a surprisingly huge 12,979 hours since yesterday (http://gyazo.com/6f28314a80c3d634da1d35dbe841cb8b). I like animals and have had at least 1 at all times throughout my life. When I started gaming I really preferred consoles for their popularity over PC, but got converted to PC by some family members. One of the first PC games I have actually ever played was CS:S! Anyway, that's about as much as I really would like to put at the moment. I can be contacted on my Reddit account, or at my 2 main e-mails: parker@wil.mico.net and parkerno552@yahoo.com  	4-6 months	I think the community can be a little bit better, and even be more mature. It seems like they really try to prey on Russians. It's almost like they're always talking about how they're bad players, constantly putting stuff like "CYKA CYKA MOTHER RUSSIA" and stuff like that in comments without some form of punishment, etc.
5/30/2015 19:43:52	http://reddit.com/user/iPlain	GMT+12	18	Some python experience, did one university paper on computer science where there was Python programming, and know a little bit of CSS and HTML, done a small amount of work on the /r/CSEventVODs CSS, adding thumbnails and such, adding RES Nightmode support.		I haven't played them as of yet, but I think they are a cool thing, especially the test of community maps.	Good to have somewhere to collect all the newbie questions, so it doesn't infest the rest of the subreddit.	I'm 18, and in my first year after High School. I live in Christchurch, New Zealand. After finishing HS, I went full time at my job at a pizza joint, and work there as a Shift Manager, about 35h a week. I'm planning on going to University and studying Mechatronics Engineering. I only recently got involved in CS:GO both as a game and as a community, as I got bored of LoL. As soon as I started playing CS, I noticed there weren't nearly as many good resources for this game as there are for League, so I worked with Clam-, to create /r/CSEventVODs, a sister sub to /r/LoLeventVODs. That is the main thing I have been working on in this community.  I spend a large portion of my time on the computer, often just browsing Reddit and updating the /r/CSEventVODs threads, so I have lots of free time to help mod, and am maybe in a timezone that you don't have much of, not sure? I'm also starting to work with the guys at lolstatsgg to track the statistics live of CS:GO matches, starting with ESEA.  My main focuses on this sub would be general modding, to keep the subreddit clean and clear of spam. I would also like to focus on the E-Sports content, working with the people who create match threads and generally looking to support that content.  I would love to work with you guys, and look forward to hearing from you, and becoming more active in the community :)	4-6 months	I haven't been here too long, only a few months, but I think its average. The reason for this is that I think the content that gets posted is for the most part very low effort, with the top right now being almost all either screenshots, or useless text posts. I find there isn't much "good" content, but that is my opinion, and I am biased towards more E-Sports content and other tutorials or tips, so that is just an opinion. Its very hard to change that though, because you don't want to over moderate, see /r/lol, and I wouldn't want to say that content I like is more relevant than the stuff that gets on the front page, and maybe its also due to the lack of good content creators for CS compared to LoL.
5/30/2015 19:45:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/silentninjabob1/	UTC-5	12	I know the basics of HTML, but not CSS or anything.	Yes, I have been an admin of a Teamspeak server, a CSGO surf server, a CSGO KZ server, and I was an admin of a CoD4 server for like a year.	I have been to 1 community night, and it was fun.	Iv'e seen it but have not participated in it.	I started playing CS about 2 and a half years ago, and I'm currently Legendary Eagle in MM, hoping to get Supreme this summer. I have an older brother that taught me how to play. CSGO Reddit was the first Reddit I have ever spent time on, and I'm hoping to get more involved in it. I have no plans to ever quit Counter Strike if I can.	10-12 months	I feel like they are a bit negative compared to other communities, but it is not really a problem to me.
5/30/2015 19:45:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/x2flyninja/	GMT-4	16	Not really :(	No unfortunately 	I think it is a good way for members of the community to get together and play some cs.	I enjoy it. I have answered and asked questions on the newbie Thursday thread.	My name is Eli, I am from Philadelphia PA. I spend a worrying amount of time on the Global offensive reddit. I play csgo competitively and have team experience. I have even made it to the front page of this very reddit a couple of times. I think I am a fair and rational person and will take that into account whenever I am moderating the page.	10-12 months	I think there have been some positive and negative side effects to the community of global offensive growing. I feel like the community has a lot of new players who are interested in learning how to play the game. The negative effect of that is that it is hard to find the opinions of very experienced members. 
5/30/2015 19:47:19	http://www.reddit.com/user/nobody_22/	GMT+1	16	Some basic Python and currently studying computer science at A-level and planing to continue at university. 	None	I've been planning on joining for a while now but never actually gotten around to it yet. I will hopefully be able to join in over the summer. I can't comment from experience however I feel the community nights are a good way to strengthen the community by having fun and getting to know people who share that enjoyment in CS.	It's a great way for both new and old players to have there questions answered. Without it there would be a much greater number of new threads of people asking these questions, many of which would likely go unanswered. It also allows more people to ask their questions and have them noticed and answered. However it could be "advertised" more as I still see a fair amount of new posts asking  basic questions that would be better suited for the Newbie Thursday threads.	I'm Leon, I go by "Nobody22" online, don't ask me why as I don't really know... I live in the UK and currently in sixth form studying computer science and IT. I've played CS:GO for ~10 months but only seriously(competitive and multiple days per week) for the last 6 months. The subreddit helped me greatly with improving at the game and I still learn more about the game every week because of it. Currently GN4 so I can't help you in the staff cup! (Kappa). On the subreddit and reddit as a whole I am quite a large lurker and spend a large amount of time on reddit and /r/globaloffensive, however I am trying to become more active in the community. Due to school right now a good part my time is spent studying however you will always find reddit open on another monitor (Which isn't always a good thing really). The rest of my free time is usually spent on counter strike whether it is playing the game, browsing the subreddit, watching a pro game, or all three at the same time. I feel I could be an active member of the moderation team and willing to do whatever I can to ensure the community remains one of the best gaming communities.	7-9 months	The community is for the most part very friendly to everyone and is very welcoming to new players. The part of the community that may not be so friendly at times are quickly downvoted which is nice to see. However as the subreddit has grown the number of low quality post has increased. I am not completely against this as I know a lot of people do like these posts as is shown by the number of upvotes and the comments.
5/30/2015 19:50:09	http://reddit.com/u/yellowtape5	UTC-5	20	Took a C# class in college but forgot it all. Also, very limited coding in LUA just setting up plugins and such for gmod servers.	I currently run a teamspeak server with 3 of my friends and we have had minecraft, gmod, csgo, killing floor, terraria, and a few other servers over the years but none that are live now. In csgo, we have had jailbreak, scrim, and minigame servers that I have either help set up or made on my own although admittedly it has been at least 8 months since I have set anything up so I am a little rusty.	I like the idea of community night but I can't say that I have actual ever participated in one mainly because I am usually watching twitch streams, playing mm, and/or browsing the subreddit.	N/A	I think I have pretty much covered everything about me, I have never even considered being a mod on the subreddit until seeing this post and I thought hey, there are lots of times when I am bored where I could actually have something to do and even help out the subreddit at the same time.	10-12 months	I like how the community is balanced between community content, the pro scene, updates to the game, funny moments that people have, to just about anything that people want to post regarding the game and that a lot of people genuinely try to help out other people who maybe don't know very much about the game because they are just starting out or maybe just learning small details after having been playing the game for years. Overall, I really like the community and everything the subreddit offers.  
5/30/2015 19:51:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/Lokindos	GMT+0	16	I have limited coding in HTML, due to learning it during my education. Please not this coding is limited, and certainly not entirely useful, but it is a foundation, and a foundation which can, if necessary, be built upon.  Apart from that no; at some point I tried to learn C++, to no avail.	Yes i do have experience admining servers. I currently host regular 10 man PUG's for a community of about 100 on my CSGO server, as well as a friends csgo server. In hosting these 10 man pugs, as well as trying out certain things on my own server (learning the in and out's of source-mod/commands etc.), I have gained experience in how to run a csgo server, and the necessary commands to do so, at increasing efficiency. This could, for example (if i were to be accepted), hand its use in order to help organize the CSGO community night. (↓)	I personally vastly enjoy the Community Nights, and have partaken in them (sporadically) for the past 2 nights or so. Not only do i think it is extremely enjoyable testing out new maps, and share constructive feedback about them with other members of the community, but I think it is a great chance to interact with the community, and play with a range of ranks which I otherwise wouldn't.  Whilst occasionally it has been difficult getting into games/coping with leavers, overall my experience with Community Night (even though it is hosted via mumble [not TS]), has been a positive one with me genuinely meeting really nice people, and being able to have interesting, stimulating conversations with fellow addicts of counter strike.	Whilst I have yet to participate in any Newbie Thursday threads myself, I do occasionally view them, and remind myself how great it is that we have such a varied community. I continuouslly find it awesome that with such a varied reddit community we manage (as a community) to be helpful and kind to players of all ranks, trying to help them out, in whatever way possible.  This is, in fact, one of the reasons that I joined the Counter-Strike Wiki Contributors program, initiated by Jpon a few weeks ago. In helping to start revolutionize our Wiki (something which is a slow, ongoing but amazingly fun process), I have not only used these Newbie Thursday threads as a basis for modernizing the wiki (especially in the "Beginner's Guide"section), but I feel I have been empowered to help the community, especially those of lower ranks, by helping to create the wiki.	I'm a 16 year old student, who has been living and studying in London, United Kingdom my whole life and am bilingual (speaking German (near-natively) and of course english).  Unlike many people within the community, I didn't grow up playing Counter Strike (something which now as a passionate Global Offensive fan i stringently regret). Instead I spent my childhood playing games such as Sims 3, Garry's Mod, a bit of Quake, Team Fortress 2 (since 2012), XBOX 360, and of course Mine-craft (I first played that in 2010 [back when it wasn't hugely popular]) (luckily i don't play it anymore).   I try to generally think of myself as a studious type person, however this never seems to be true. Like many others I am huge procrastinator, and have spent the past year or so playing PC games (basically just CS) instead of revising for exams (something which hasn't actually hindered me that much), (My exams are over now)  I hope you consider me :)  	4-6 months	Although I've only actively been on the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit since about February, I feel I've experienced the community from such a range of angles, in such a short space of time.  I personally think that the subreddit is a sprawled collusion of ideas and tips, glitches and AMA's, debates and tournaments, and that is really what I love about it. Every day while scrolling through the Subreddit i continuously see something new; be it posts regarding the problems us Counter Strike problems face, or the Gif's of humours events happening in game, the community never ceases to not-fulfil my satisfaction.  
5/30/2015 19:51:58	http://reddit.com/u/ImVoi	GMT+0	19	Basic knowledge of HTML and have edited a few CSS templates for my website.	Hosted a DayZ server briefly a year ago that was hosted on my PC for a few weekS before migrating to a Vilayer hosted server. This didn't last long and only attracted about 10 people max most being friends. I've also helped with managing a Minecraft server for my Website a while back.	I'm a big fan of Community Nights, especially when related to gaming. Something i'm pushing to get started myself on my forum. 	Seems a solid idea. But after the initial Question and Answer i've seen it often become another medium for people to complain about issues with the game. Which happens everywhere else on the sub as it is so i understand it isn't exactly avoidable, But especially if the posts are for "Newbies" and they keep seeing everyone complain about the game it might draw them to be negative about the game also. However it certainly does occur less often here than other threads, Only a few examples i've found. I'd suggest at the end of the post/day someone picking a few of the most upvoted questions and compiling them into a single post so people dont need to search the whole post to find anything they're looking for. I know you guys suggest people upvoting for visibility but some get missed still.	I'm 19 years old, From the UK. My names Jordan :) I'm an Admin(Ex Co-Owner) on another forum (protechmodz.com - My name on it is Voi) and have been for not long off 4 years now so i have a lot of experience with Moderating posts and what not despite the sites size in comparison to this subs. I'm LE in CS;GO, Have about 800 combined hours on the game and have around 200 hours combined in CS:S. I'd say i'm a nice guy, i can be sarcastic about things sometimes but it's all in good nature. I'm always near a device able to connect to the internet so i'm pretty much always available/able to be on the Sub. I believe i'll be able to contribute to the Subs Moderation in a great way due to my previous experience and overall love of the game. Thanks :)	7-9 months	I spend most of my time lurking as i'm usually late to the party on some things/ busy with work but i like how it is now. I've contributed to some Feedback Questionnaires from the mods and strongly made my thoughts clear that i'd hope the forum doesn't take a large adoption of memes and such. I think it'll ruin the sub if you guys allow them in large numbers and i'm happy with how it is now. I guess i have no issues with the mods, which would be a good thing as you guys dont seem to piss off the members as i dont see any hate threads and such. I think there's a good balance between fun related discussion on the Sub and Serious discussion such as the Update posts (However infrequent they are) and the Pro game discussion threads. I often read through them. 
5/30/2015 19:53:42	http://www.reddit.com/user/HeisenSwag/	GMT+2	20	I am an Assistant for Screendesign. Meaning that I have basic to medium knowledge in HTML and CSS (a little bit of other code as well but nothing really worth mentioning)	No but I have a friend who does that for a living (server administration for businesses, not csgo) who I can ask on some opionions but no experience myself other than renting from Nitrado	Never took part in it but think its a cool idea.	Very nice concept, helped me out a few times while reading and seeing something then thinking "huh, yeah never thought of that. Seems reasonable"	Ive been playing cs:go since the release, Counter Strike it self for almost 5 years now (since im 16 y/o, ill be 21 in august) and started on the lower ranks, meaning around Silver Elite. Ive been getting better and better but never really became really good. Right now I am around DMG Level. Keeping this in mind, Ive had my time with all aspects of the community. From "rush b dont stop" russians to super friendly british people (I am german myself  by the way).  I am also a moderator and frequent viewer on all kind of Twitch Channels. There I get to know many other people to play with but also see people higher rank than me and learn to understand their thoughts.  Concerning my English skills: I am German but spent a Year in Montana, USA and went to 11th grade in High School. Therefore I speak quite fluently.  I am currently finishing my A-Levels, after that I want to study Social Media Communications and my dream job would be to work as a Community Manager for a big gaming company. I love interacting with users and helping them resolve their problems as good as I can.  Thank you for taking your time reading my little application and I hope my english isnt too terrible for you too understand.	13-18 months	Right now a lot of it is just being butthurt about Streams (PhantomL0rd and  those kind of streamers).  Definetly becamse worse when the community grew. In my opinion there should be stricter rules concerning what to post.
5/30/2015 19:54:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/imphono	GMT+4	17		I admin on two retake servers located in montreal, that have about 20-30 users across both servers most times.	I love community nights I play in them every chance I get, though I sometimes feel bad as the teams get stacked no matter what you do and someone ends up not having fun. but hey that's counter-strike! 	Helping people is always great, I adopted two players so far ( silver 4 and DMG )  It's quite easy to teach players 1 on 1 if you have the time :)	Im just a Guy living in a small town who is probably the only one that even plays CSGO  here lol.  I have lots of free time because of this and I end up playing counter-strike 4-6 hours a day most the time.  Im trying to become more active in the community. I never really found out about community night until like 3 months ago to be honest.   I find my self wasting away hours and hours on the computer, so I guess you could call me a nerd :)	19-24 months	I feel like reddit is the place for people to spread their hate towards companies and players recently and less unique content, but you guys are working on keeping the band wagon[s] to a minimum.   Also I love this sub-Reddit for patch warnings and big events that just happened or are happening.  I feel as though if you need to know something you can home here.  Over the time I have been here the community has grown insane amounts. Saw friends leave and new ones come in the end it's pretty darn good :) 
5/30/2015 19:57:18	http://reddit.com/u/MooshC	UTC-7	14	Not really	I've had a little experience moderating, but nothing too big.	I love community night's and usually show up for them. I think it's great for the community to interact that way together.	I think its a good idea for new people to ask some basic questions, and maybe even more advanced players to ask some more advanced questions.	I live in California, US. I like art and graphic design (altho im not the best at it.) I'm a straight A student currently going into my first year of high school after summer. I like football (American) and skateboarding. I've played CS:GO since December 2014 and have fallen in love with it. I'm GN3. Many say that I'm mature for my age, including some of my CS:GO friends. I get a long well with people and tend to be a bit quiet, but I can very well express my opinions. That is all :)	4-6 months	I think its a really nice community, I never really see rude people. I definitely rate this community over a lot of other ones. I enjoy coming on here and watching someone's video of a "sick ace" or "unrepeatable smoke" and then looking at the comments and seeing a bunch of nice comments.
5/30/2015 19:58:19	https://www.reddit.com/u/SoKawaiii/	GMT+4	16	Yes, I code Java and C++. I've been coding in Java for around 2 - 3 years now, and C++ for around one year. 	No.	I don't really participate in Community Night.	It's great for new people to ask questions and to help them get used to the game, which would most likely result in them getting their friends to join CSGO and the community, as well.	Tennis is my hobby and coding is my love... who I'm cheating on with CSGO.   :) 	7-9 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is awesome (besides the trolls and flamers, of course). People help one another and share their opinions on things, while others post funny gifs and "fluff." 
5/30/2015 20:00:13	http://www.reddit.com/user/leflaffed	GMT+0	14	I have base knowledge in HTML, PHP and CSS. Mostly HTML.	I host an CS: GO server at home for my team. And I have hosted an Minecraft server for the Icelandic Minecraft Community, from home too.	They are a good way for people to hang out in a good community and play some relaxing CS and helping with playtesting. I have only played once in it but want to more.	I think it is a good way for people to share tips and tricks with others as well as helping others to improve and sharing information. It has helped me a lot with starting out with my team as well as I go over them for questions I might find useful.	Hi, my name is Árni from Iceland. I look at my self as an guy working hard for something, being efficient and doing things well. I work best with people that have good teamwork. If I don't know something I will find it out. I am good with English and hope to be an programmer in the future and working with an company teaching programming and other things like Minecraft and creating videos, called SKEMA. I play this game a lot, maybe too much but I love it and can never get enough of it.  Feel free to contact me if you want more info.  Thanks in advance, Árni.	4-6 months	They are varied, which makes them fun. I love the puns. I think they haven't really changed, just new people getting in. I haven't seen mods be other than helpful and humorous.  
5/30/2015 20:01:54	http://reddit.com/u/the_only_luke	GMT+1	18	basic understandings of html, c++, vb.net. learning java next school year	Hosted minecraft servers for over 1 year. Had 2,200 unique visitors, and 8 moderators. 	although i have not participated in community night i understand it to be a fun way for the community to play together. It gives map creators the chance to get feedback on their newly designed maps from a community of players wanting csgo to grow.   Following the map testing, players get to compete in eu and na 10 mans and can talk on mumble. The community does not reject lower ranks.	I have never commented on Newbie Thursday although i read through it a lot. I love the tips for useful binds, and read through peoples advice to rank up. I usually order the comments by "top" as it allows me to read through the posts that people have found most helpful	My names Luke, most people know me by Transfer. I love csgo with a passion and believe I can help the community. 	13-18 months	As csgo has grown so has our reddit community. I love the new banners, and ama by the pros & casters. I feel the community is like a family, even the pro players use reddit.
5/30/2015 20:06:21	http://www.reddit.com/user/Brinkboss/	GMT+1	15	I have very basic knowledge of java, im currently doing a GSCE in computing science which involves coding a program using java. Again, very basic knowledge, i wouldnt be able to see a fix something if it was even slightly complicated.	Yes, I have managed 2 medium sized minecraft servers and 1 large Garry's Mod server, The 2 minecraft servers I was a moderator on for about 6 months each but both servers sadly shutdown due to lack of funding. The Garry's Mod server I was a moderator trainee for a month until the 2 owners had a fallout and one of them ended up destroying the server :[.	I think it is a awesome idea for CSGO, It makes the community unite for a day and not argue and just have a good game on good servers. I prefer to do the community play test myself as i find the normal maps pretty boring.	It is a very good way of making new players of CSGO staying and giving them a good introduction to the community aswell as giving them advice on how to get better and have more fun while playing CSGO.	My name is Kieran Fox(If anyone mentions What does the fox say...) and I live in england. Im 15 and am currently doing my GCSEs.  My favourite game is CSGO and browsing this subreddit has become a habit when im bored on my phone, which is why I am trying out for moderator, CSGO has a very important job in my life. If I didnt have CSGO my stress levels would be too much to handle especially now im doing tests. I like to consider myself very mature but id say thats a biased opinion, im also very shy and may take a while to come out of my shell and actually open up to people. Id say im very thick skinned and can take alot of insults, along with this ive been called very calm and relaxed even in bad situations. I have a very dark humour which can often get me into trouble( I cant time jokes very well). That is it for me without getting into my personal life and details id rather keep for close friends.	0-3 months	Honestly, It is a very friendly and informative place to be, but i also think that it becomes VERY toxic when the words "hack" or "cheats" are even mentioned. It sort of becomes a witch hunting playground, id guess that if there were no rules that the subreddit would be full of the stuff. I also get a very football esk vibe from the community when it comes to talking about teams and matches, which can be a good thing and a bad thing looking at where I live.
5/30/2015 20:06:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/Gamertroid/	GMT+0	14	I've learnt a little HTML, CSS and Python and plan on trying to fully learn HTML and CSS in the near future.	I have administrated one teamspeak server before for a gaming community. I have also moderated a subreddit for a League Of Legends league! I also currently moderate the official PC Master Race Twitch channel whenever we are live and I'm available!	Awesome way to bring the community together and give map makers feedback.	Great way to help new players and veterans learn about the game from others. 	Hi! My name is Daniel (most people call me Dan though), I'm 14 and I've been gaming since I was 3! I'm from Britain (The place where tea is adored and monarchy is prevalent).  I have been playing this game since release but I have only started to play it actively since December 2014. I'm currently ranked at MG1 with more games played to get there then I care to admit :D. I mainly play with some guys I know from school but I love to find other nice people from the sub and in my games to play with. I actually remember meeting a awesome guy I love talking to frequently off the sub on the Adopt-A-Silver thread back when I was a scrubby silver around Christmas. He really helped me improve as a whole :D  In my free time I mainly play CS but I also enjoy playing Hearthstone and League Of Legends. I'm planning on trying to get to Legend on Hearthstone next month :D. Apart from that I don't do much else apart from homework and going out with friends on the odd occasion, meaning I have lots of free time ;-)  I'd just like to personally thank you guys before I end this for helping nurture such a helpful community full of awesomeness!   Gamertroid	4-6 months	I think they can be a bit cruel at time, though all communities can be like that but at heart they are pretty funny normal people who enjoy playing the game and sharing their experiences!
5/30/2015 20:07:55	http://reddit.com/u/buccola1215	GMT+1	15	No,sorry.	I had at one point moderated a community CS:GO server	I am often not at a computer at those times, but if I was I would participate.	I enjoy them, sometimes I comment for help and I often comment to help people.	My name is Christian, I am 15. The main gaming subreddits I browse are this one, r/globaloffenisvetrade, and r/FIFA. I also play soccer for my high school, so I enjoy browsing r/Soccer and keeping up with the pro scene. The reason I want to be moderator is that I would enjoy becoming even more active in the community and helping as well. That's about it, thanks for taking the time to read my application.	7-9 months	It seems positive for the most part, I especially enjoy some of the AMA's.
5/30/2015 20:10:22	http://reddit.com/u/commanderbly	UTC-5	19	HTML, Javascript, CSS	Not CS:GO, but I ran a Minecraft server for my freinds last year.	It's a great way to build a sense of community, and I hope I can participate in more events in the future.	It's great for new players, but I feel like most people just make a new topic to ask questions.	I've been playing CS:GO since august 2012, and I've been part of the subreddit for almost as long!  Helping the community flourish and grow is my number one priority and I hope that you'll give me the chance to try.	19-24 months	Very hive-minded, but luckily it isn't toxic.  I do feel like a lot of the new posts get downvoted to 0 for unknown reasons though.
5/30/2015 20:10:51	http://www.reddit.com/user/KintamasCS	GMT-5	19	No I do not have any experience in any sort of coding.	I do have some experience in administrating servers - one that I can recall and currently help administer is the CSBCamp community servers from across all of the available gamemodes such as 1v1 arena, FFA DM and KZ servers - and a couple of servers for a clan community a year or so ago.	I think community nights are a good way to interact with the many users of the subreddit and help bring essence to the community itself that it offers with playtesting and overall just trying out new things with different people that they would otherwise not have an opportunity to. 	Newbie Thursday is a good addition and helps bring forward many of the problems that beginners may have in the community but no others thoughts on it.	Well my name is Jimmy, I currently live in Rhode Island - one of the smallest states in the United States. I'm 19 years old, currently on break from college for the summer. I have around 1500 hours in Counter Strike: Global Offensive alone, and have a feel for and love the game in. I usually spend my days playing the game, train and such and head to work in the afternoon. I'm online most of the time so I'm usually always available. There's not really much to say about me, I guess you can see I'm a nerd with the monotone voice. That's all!	10-12 months	My thoughts on the /r/GlobalOffensive community as a whole.. well I think the best of it. It shows how much people like to help others by offering their wisdom, there's enough fluff for days and the overall experience even for a new subreddit user is great. What I really love about the community is that lately people have made the effort to share their opinions about what things need to be changed and fixed and somehow Valve is watching - this shows that the community (the subreddit) even though it's not the whole CSGO player base but a big chunk of it has the power to speak up and get things changed when they need to be changed.
5/30/2015 20:13:59	http://reddit.com/u/coastalsailing	GMT-5	30	Not really. 	Nope	Its wonderful. 	One of the best executed new-user friendly threads in any sub.	I've played cs since early beta days... .8? Off and on for different periods of my life. I've been back in to it for a few years now, since CSGO dropped and I love it more than ever. The game is better than ever, and the awesome community that has sprung up around it only enhances it. This sub reddit has actually been a huge part of my development as a player, thanks to the resources I found here. It has deepened my relationship with the game. I've always loved cs, but now I'm halfway decent at it. (Mge right now)  In my offline life I work in shipping. I used to sail professionaly too and was extremely involved in the traditional sail world and experiential education.   My other non professional passion is climbing. Rock and ice. 	2-3 years	Ooofff..... It's degraded over time.... More and more the comment threads become circle jerks or a meme call and response.  That being said, there's some great content sometimes, whether fluff or more substantiative.  People seem more quick to be rude, but that may be my own subjective opinion.   Popularity has its drawbacks I guess. 
5/30/2015 20:17:27	http://reddit.com/u/Leotin_	GMT+2	18	In small amounts of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Also databases are familiar.	Sorry, none.	I have never participated, mostly due to the lack of time around these times. 	A great way for beginners and veterans to gather around and ask questions. 	I'm a 18 year old informations and communications student I am done with my studies in about a year. I am branching towards IT-support and such. That's why I would want to have practice for more important things. Like moderating a big subreddit.  I spend several hours on a computer due to my studies and past-time. And yes, I play CS:GO, not in enormous amounts but a couple of hours a day. I am a social and a loyal person. And also co-working with other people is not an issue for me in any way.  So that sums up pretty good what I assume you want to know about me.  Cheers, Leo.	13-18 months	It's usually friendly. I like it. No one always agrees exactly to everything which creates debates and which can create new perspectives about seeing a specific matter.
5/30/2015 20:19:06	http://reddit.com/user/Aperture_Sci	GMT-5	26	I have taken Rd Hat 124 for the RHSA cert, familiar with multiple languages of code for reading, however, in my day-to-day, I do not code.	I was admin of a server in 2002-206 for CS:S. It was a public casual server for users to use (used to pay $8.88 a month through parents credit card until 16)	N/A	I think that Newbie Thursday is a great idea - Counter Strike is becoming the largest gaming community via reddit, and any way, shape, or form to benefit these users and make them more comfortable is a great way to boost ourselves as a community. 	I currently work for the NOC for the Yahoo Network Operations Center; recently promoted from Operations Engineer to Team Lead for the Incident Management Team. I have Certifications in Public Speaking, Effective Technical Writing, Project Management, and ITIL Foundations. Working with IT as a business is my background, and I am pretty open to discussion.  In my off time, I recently built a house in Buffalo, NY, single, play CS:GO usually every day, and am a avid trader. I have built relationships with Etherfast, Cyborg, and a large amount of the tradin community. 	10-12 months	I personally believe the /r/GlobalOffensive community is deep-down genuinely nice men, women, boys, and girls - however, some people abuse the anonymity of typing behind keyboards. One of the major issues with our community is that we deal with prices that fluctuate more than the NYS Exchange, so it understandable some people get upset while trading, bidding, buying, etc... We really need to realize we are dealing with individuals as a whole, and work together to make the place less volatile. 
5/30/2015 20:26:55	http://reddit.com/u/hobobob182	UTC-4	15	A little CSS coding a subreddit, for sure not enough to really be credible in anything.	I've moderated/administrated a couple of GMod servers before. I know this isn't really that impressive, but I never really have tried moderating servers/subreddits. It just didn't seem that interesting, but with /r/GlobalOffensive it's very different cause I have a great love for the game and the  community.	I've never really tried it.	I've never really tried it.	Well my life is reddit besides CS:GO, so let's get a little in to that :D, I have a current 1,900 hours on CS:GO if you add up both my accounts http://steamcommunity.com/id/KmS_CSGO_2 and http://steamcommunity.com/id/KmS_CSGO . I love reddit and CSGO and that's basically my boring life (:	7-9 months	I really love the community, and rarely see anything wrong with it, but when I do, I hate how I can't do anything about it. I love our current mods, and think they're doing a fantastic job at interacting with the community, as well as keeping it clean. It has changed a lot for the good, and for the worse over time, and I don't think anything will change that process but the community in whole itself. 
5/30/2015 20:59:01	http://reddit.com/u/monkzize	GMT+2	18	css for http://reddit.com/r/documentaires	Slightly with IRC servers	A good way to meet new people	Makes the community grow by welcoming new players in a way that makes them stay	Friendly, altho I can be a bit too straightforward / honest.  I'm from the Netherlands and 1% Danish if I have to believe my family (this might explain my love for cs) recently finished my exams and I'll get the results on the 11th of June so I've got roughly 4 á 5 months of vacation.   I used to comment frequently on reddit but stopped as of late as I didn't feel the need to.   I haven't said a lot of things on /r/GlobalOffensive compared to my comment count on other subreddits as well.   My first contact with the pro scene of csgo was after watching the final of battlefield on Dreamhack winter 2013 (this is where my love for CH wolves came from) after it ended I wanted more and decided to watch DH csgo.  I also watch just about any type of esports from DOTA to CoD I find them all enjoyable and know a bit about each scene too.   I'm not really bothered to become the new public face of the subreddit and prefer to remain on the sidelines with just about anything including arguments, I'm not afraid however to voice my opinion and tell people if they break the rules etc. and the reason why as well as what they should do instead, I have the slight feeling this might be unnecessary as not every subreddit finds the last do of the modiquete(?) necessary.   An additional side note the UK currently doesn't use GMT as it's summer time. So GMT+1 for central Europe becomes GMT+2 (technically speaking.)   Edit: my Steam profile is http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkzize more details such as playtime can be found there. 	13-18 months	Pretty horrible at times regarding their opinions about the pro scene, for example casters, colour-casters etc.   But also circlejerky and friendly. 
5/30/2015 20:30:05	http://reddit.com/u/Bricci	UTC-5	17	No.	No.	I love interacting with other players of this sub, and it's fun to try new maps and meet new people. Everyone is friendly and it's generally a good time.	Hell, it surely helps me and I'm for sure not a noob. It's a great feature of this sub and I check it all the time.	I like to see things tidy and organized, something I feel this sub may lack at times. However, this is the main website I visit when browsing the internet, and there aren't many problems with it.  I like to play CS:GO in my downtime (rank; DMG) and go to school/work in my other time. I'm an active cyclist and skateboarder. I play volleyball and generally like to be social. I'm a pretty smart guy (3.9 GPA) and I think I could be a good addition to the team when it comes to things as far as solving problems and organizing things. Thanks for the opportunity!	7-9 months	There are a lot of new people here, but I'm surprised at the limit of toxicity. I don't mind the occasional shitpost or fluff post, because humor really brings this community together when it comes to discussing this game.
5/30/2015 20:32:44	https://www.reddit.com/user/defl0rate/	GMT+10	18	A little bit in visual basic, but I don't think that helps	Well about 6 years ago, me and some friends from school had a 16 slot server for CS 1.6 and I was one of the admins. My job was just set up mixes and change maps based on what people wanted. I don't remember how they were hosted, but we would usually play normal de_ maps, surf maps, vip and other mods. Awww that was fun	I really would like to participate in any of them because I like social interaction but there is one problem: timezone and distance (damn Australia). So yea I wish I could be active with this ;_;	I read them every week! Certainly many tips have helped me since I'm a Gold Nova Master garbage and I'm learning even more about the game, from the basics to advanced stuff!	Hello r/globaloffensive team, my name is André Law, also known as defl0rate, but you can call me ''des''. Since my early online gaming days, when I was 10 years old, I've always wanted to be active with a community. Back then, I played many online RPGs such as Priston Tale, Grand Chase, Cabal, Mu etc and happened to me a moderator on 4 different game forums some time later. I like interacting with people, and doing it online seems easier than irl. I can't describe how I'm willing to be a mod on reddit right now, on my favorite sub. I REALLY want to be even more active and help any user over there. Answer mod mail, delete hurtful posts, receive feedback and anything that is needed in this job. I have the patience to act correctly in any circumstance and make sure both sides are satisfied in the end. I hope you like my application! See ya  Also I'm not sure if that's the right timezone, but it is AEST (Melbourne, Australia)	4-6 months	It is by far my favorite subreddit. The mods do a good job keeping all the sub organized and also the users have interesting content to share. The only thing I hate are gLoBaL eLiTe w/e guys bashing people because they are not good enough or just want to brag about their rank and playing CS for 10 years etc etc. They don't seem to realize that no one just simply was born with the skill to play the game at the highest level and they think their opinion is the absolute truth. Anyway, there's people like this everywhere, they just don't have my respect. It's a game, can't you play it to have fun? On the other side, there are GE people (or at least their flair) who are pretty nice and contribute to a discussion in a positive way. 
5/30/2015 20:33:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/RealitysAtombin/	GMT+0	15	Not really, i've looked into it, and assisted with making a relatively straightforward CSGO Stat page. 	Previously been an admin on my clan's war server until it was discontinued and currently Administrate on our Teamspeak.	Great way of engaging with the community and building a strong bond.	Another fantastic idea aimed at helping those with relatively limited CS experience. 	James Anthony Key, 15. In-Game leader and Deputy clan leader of the (previous ClanBase winners) CS clan Apex Outcasts. Metallica and Muse fan, NiP, Vox Eminor and Virtus Pro fan.  Be aware i am taking a Month long vacation starting July 12th and finishing August 4th, just after my 16th birthday.  Anymore questions feel free to PM me at http://steamcommunity.com/id/realitysatombin or even drop a text +447475922242  Thank you for reading and considering, im sure you've alot to cover!	13-18 months	Diverse, certainly. Sometimes people can get a bit "salty" and offensive to each other however that is expected with every community. With that sometimes the same idea is floated around for what seems like months (Hitboxes, Tec-9, hackusations- whilst they are all important they dont need to take up every other post). On the whole a fantastically unique community. 
5/30/2015 20:33:33	http://reddit.com/user/Taremz	GMT-4	17	Basic HTML, nothing too fancy. A little PHP and a little Javascript. I know enough that I could recognize and understand code, but I'm not the best at actually creating.	I have admined and modded dozens of servers across various games. Several TTT servers on Garry's Mod, several Minecraft servers, and even a TF2 server for a few weeks.  All of these were fairly casual servers. Nothing competitive or serious. At the time, they were all servers I frequented and enjoyed. I felt the need to help the community, so I stepped up and helped moderate each of them.  Each position probably lasted a few months each, with the longest ones lasting a few years. Minecraft and TTT specifically.  As embarrassing as it is, I was also heavily involved with a few roleplaying communities on a few different platforms; one of which being Garry's Mod. These were the largest communities I was involved with. Some of them had several hundred active members. I mainly moderated the forums and websites for these communities, but I was by no means absent in-game!  I'd be happy to share more details on each server I staffed, as well as names and specifics. Just contact me.  Jake doesn't get to know about my roleplaying habits, however.	It's a great way to get involved with the community. I'm not sure if any other gaming subreddits participate in something similar, but they should.   Anything that brings a community closer together can only be good in my book. Playing games with each other is a great way to do this.  It also brings the mods down to Earth, in my opinion. Moderators can seem so high above the users of a Subreddit, especially big ones like CS:GO. Actually interacting and playing with the mods helps the average user realize that they're just people too, enjoying a game and community.  Only positive feelings for community night!	Certainly no negative opinions on it. Again, it's another event that brings the community together, and a chance for players to improve their game.   I'm actually thinking about getting into it myself! As a newbie, of course... I need help improving my game!	"Don't be afraid to be wordy :-)" You will regret those words.  I'll start with CS:GO. I love the competitive scene! I don't know much about the teams, but it's always relaxing to watch the streams. I have a pretty solid knowledge of the meta, but my actual gameplay needs work. Still working on those spray-patterns and headshots! I only have about 74 hours played, which isn't a lot compared to most players. I know the basics of the game, however, and can play the game seriously when I need to. I've been playing pretty consistently over the past few weeks, too! I have a bad habit of opening cases. I can't help myself! I usually give away the skins anyways...  I just finished my Junior year of High School, and am going into my Senior year in August. I have a 3.7 GPA.  My dream is to get into the Air Force Academy, get my degree in Astrospace Engineering, fly for the military, and maybe settle down at Lockheed or Boeing after a few years of flying. I want to be a rocket scientist, and perhaps an astronaut! I always say the future is in the sky. We aren't getting anywhere on Earth, so let's move somewhere else.  I play soccer with my friends when I am not playing video games!  I was very big into TF2, but I've left that community for CS:GO quite recently. After getting more seriously involved, I have to say I am hooked, and am now looking to get much more heavily involved than before. I believe moderating /r/GlobalOffensive is a great way for me to do that!  Favorite games of all time have to be the Mass Effect series, KOTOR II, Bastion, the Deus Ex serious, and Terraria (for relaxing!). I'm a big fan of RPGs.  I'm a friend of /u/Jpon9, as much as he might deny it. I force my friendship down his throat. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Currently unemployed, but looking to change that! I have held three different jobs, and have left all of them on my own terms.  The vast majority of my Reddit Karma was gathered over the course of a week or two. I made it my goal to get into The Century Club (100k Karma), but I got bored and quit. All my posting nowadays is mostly done in smaller Subreddits with communities I enjoy. I generally delete most of my comments, though, because I get embarrassed at my past-self when I look through my history. Rest assured, this habit would end if I received a position as moderator.  It's my goal to play on a competitive CS:GO team. Probably nothing major, just me and 4 other friends. But entering a tournament sounds fun, and I'm trying my best!  I've always kinda wanted to getting into   I have 4 siblings. I am the oldest.  I have my own laptop, and have access to the Internet 24/7.  I'm usually very passionate about what I do. Once I start a project I enjoy, I commit myself to it fully. I live by the words, "If it's worth doing, it's worth over-doing." I don't half-ass tasks or jobs.  I basically live on Reddit. My free time is comprised of Reddit and video games. Occasional social activities are sparse but enjoyable.  I'm heavily involved with my school's robotics team. I was a major leader on the team last year, and will continue to assist the team next year.  I'm very good with video-editing and sound-editing software! Making videos is a hobby of mine.  Single :(  I am a very attractive male. Which makes the whole "single" thing very bizarre.  I don't like using text-based chats when I can use voice-based chats. Faster and easier to convey opinions and emotions.  I haven't moderated Reddit-based communities very much. I only moderate a small Subreddit for my Clash of Clans group. I am familiar with most of the tools, however!  I like to shoot actual guns as a side-hobby. I mostly shoot trap with a double barrel shotgun, but I like to visit the indoor range to shoot my father's AR-15 and assortment of handguns. Unfortunately, IRL shooting experience does not translate well to CS:GO.  I built my own computer! Picked all the parts out and assembled it myself. I'm generally a DIY person. If I can do something myself, I generally do.  I'm an introvert kind-of guy. I like hanging out with one or two friends at a time.  I'm a big fan of trying new things. I'll never turn down an opportunity to try something new, whether it be food or games or anything else!  I like to relax with Minecraft or Terraria. I'm not very good at making big creative projects, but I take pride in the little things that I do.  I'm a Logitech fanboy. I have a keyboard, two mice, and a headset from them. Looking to get another keyboard from them too!  If you need any other information from me, feel free to send me a message over Reddit!	10-12 months	I've been browsing this Subreddit frequently for the past year or so. A more specific time frame would be about 10 months.  I've watched a lot of changes happen, a lot of drama go down, and a lot of fun being had. The one thing that I can say about the community is that it has consistency. There will always be drama in a big E-Sport game like CS:GO. There will always be funny moments in competitive play. There will always be a demand for chicken flairs. I love being a part of it all, even if I didn't understand it some of it at the time.  Some people say that the community has changed over time. I think it's the same, except larger. The drama starters are still there. Changes are  still being made to the game, and people are still complaining about it. Chicken flairs are still in high demand (AND ALWAYS WILL BE AS LONG AS I BREATHE). The only difference I see is there are more people complaining, more people having fun, and more people in general. And I think that's good!  TL;DR I love the community, and will continue to be a part of it no matter what happens.
5/30/2015 20:42:49	http://www.reddit.com/u/MyNameIsNavy	GMT+0	20	No	no	I think they're a good idea, they help bring the community together so people aren't just names without a voice and people can make friends	A good addition to the subreddit that can help newbie's learn the game and everything surrounding it	I'm a 20 year old CSGO player from England. I've moderated many smaller communities before, as well as moderating a mildly popular Garry's Mod server a couple of years ago.  In addition to playing CSGO. i'm into many other games like Hearthstone and SMITE. i have a foot in nearly every gaming genre available and am always willing to get involved in the community surrounding the game.  I'm a very active person on reddit and i love moderating, not because of the feeling of power, but because you feel like you're really helping the community grow by interacting with the users and helping people out	7-9 months	The /r/GO community is a very welcoming community, full of helpful people new and old who are willing to listen to the newbies and less knowledgeable and guide them to the right path  I also think the community really comes together through LAN tournaments and the esports scene as a whole. like a normal sports community: people have a favorite but they respect everyone else's choices too.
5/30/2015 20:43:37	http://reddit.com/u/Meinskur	GMT+1	23	I have some experience with HTML and C++  I was in Uni reading computer science but dropped out for personal reasons.	I have no prior experience in this field	I feel that this aspect of this sub reddit will fall in very good hands with most of the users on here, I helps create a bond between the users.  I have never participated in 'Community Night' but feel that it has a positive impact on this community	I love Newbie Thursday, when ever someone I know is starting CS:GO I always direct them to this particular thread so that they can learn from the more experienced players and/or ask questions themselves.	I'm 23 years old, I live in a little place called 'The Faroe Islands'.. it's a set of 18 islands in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. there are only 50.000 people living here, so it's a small place compared to other countries.  I have been part of the internet since I was around 10-11 years old so I've surfed the 'interwebz' for about 12 years now.   I'm a pretty calm dude, I enjoy myself a cold beer and to just chill with my friends and play some CS:GO over TS.  I'm the kind of guy that just want's to have fun, but when the match is close, I get my serious on, and try to lead the team to victory.  let me be honest, I used to be 'that guy' that raged hardcore, hated to loose. I have even broken around 3 controllers to my PS3 when I had it. but something has changed over the years, and I am not that person anymore. I have, for some reason or the other, managed to change my perspective and totally changed myself.   oh, and you might not see it in this application, but I love emojis... I think it's a European thing.  anyway, English is my third language, but I feel pretty comfortable with it. even got an A+ in English in Collage ( hope bragging is OK ;) )  last but not least, good job to all the mods, hope to see the improvements continue. good luck in the future. !   - Meinskur OUT!	19-24 months	I have been lurking the sub-reddit for some time, but would say that I became active around oct/nov of 2014.. I liked the sub back then, there has been some change, I can't exactly put my finger on what has changed, but the feel of it has changed.  I think that that since the mod application thread back in dec of 2014 has had a big impact on this thread for some reason. (again, can't really put my finger on what it is :D )  Personally I think that as of right now, there are way too many fluff posts on the 'top' section of  /r/GlobalOffensive, but you know, the people get what the people want, right?
5/30/2015 20:49:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/16161d/	GMT+1	21	Basic HTML & CSS, but probably not enough consistency (or interest) to be of any immediate use in any coding related work.	Not CS:GO no, but I am have a very dedicated server admin for the top Day of Defeat 1.3 (the original WW2 HL mod) servers for the past 3 years, duties involving:  - being active in-game to interact with our userbase - solving issues in and out of games - handling player issues, bans and appeals through a ticket system, private messaging and on steam - actively responding to posts on the forums - organising and training other admins - handling the recruitment of new members - being involved in the discussion of a wide range of player related issues and effective solutions - handling difficult situations without bias or letting emotion affect my better judgement - being in charge of reviewing demos and cheating accusations - managing a private server from HLSW for small events  (While I have a small amount of experience in managing the said private server, I don't have any knowledge in source servers or server management in general outside of being in the server to moderate it)	It's not something I've taken part in, my time on CSGO is generally restricted to just playing matchmaking with some friends from uni maybe once or twice a day.	I seem to recall it being pretty useful and interesting when I first found the sub, although I'm a very quick learner and my reading habits on the subreddit tend to be more specific. I think it's a pretty cool weekly event though.	Well, speaking of wordy, I am a very wordy person, I seem to have an inability to write less than 1000 words in any given post. (this is honestly only half joking)  I do write a lot, which is why I tend to stay out of discussions unless I feel I can genuinely contribute a unique viewpoint or useful information to a discussion or topic, but it means if there was any discussions in the mod team, you would certainly hear my very heavy 2 cents on what topics we discuss.  I'm 21 (next week), live in London and study Contemporary Media Practice, main area of professional practice being music technology and composition, but always been very involved online and in gaming. (see for yourself: http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoahk)  I'm active online pretty most days for long periods of time, gonna have quite a lot of free time this summer, I'm always checking on this subreddit and reddit in general every few minutes while browsing or working.  I feel i'm mature enough and wise enough through my experience with dealing with people online and in-game to do a good job and be active in the duties listed. As I mentioned I am really more of a lurker, so I'd probably be most effective in responding to mod mail, reported posts and dealing with posts breaking the rules. I'd probably need some time to fully adapt to the guidelines on what posts to look out for, but this would probably be no challenge for me and you mention the trial period is there for that reason.  I'm certainly no troll, always been committed to the communities I am apart of and encouraging a friendly environment free of the assholes who seem to want to just ruin everything for the hell of it, that being said I'm a very tolerant person unless something or someone is very clearly violating the terms I agree to take action on.  I will be honest and say at the time of writing this I am only really 70% sure about this position. I applied awhile back (albeit with less enthusiasm), so I will see how the selection process goes as it doesn't hurt to put in my application and see how things turn out, might be more hyped for the position by then.    	4-6 months	I think it may be improving. The reddit hive mind / circle jerk culture is still very strong here though, which at times makes it pretty difficult to read what the popular opinion of the week or day can be, although I'm very accepting of people holding different views as I believe they're all valid, still, this community can be pretty embarrassing at times, but I wouldn't say it's any better anywhere else really and despite the sometimes embarrassing behaviour of others it's been my homepage for a long time.  I generally don't engage much in any discussion on the subreddit anymore, I am a huge lurker though and in my moderation positions have always been more of a behind the scenes person.  I do think the mod team has done a brilliant job, I'm still fairly newish to reddit but very quick to pick up on how communities in general behave and what the culture of a place is, and I know reddit has had a lot of drama regarding some subreddits moderators, but you have clearly done a good job at staying out of these scandals and not causing any drama, the mods are mature and respectable, and there is no power tripping here, it feels like there is a lot of freedom to express yourself in this reddit and I tend not to see any posts that are just complete nonsense or smut, which means you must be doing something right.  I'm very interested in this community, and I've spent a considerable amount of time studying it, the drama, and the current news on the game and competitive scene.
5/30/2015 20:52:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/ehmsen	GMT+2	22	I have done some free tutorials on the internet, but I might take some courses in the future for my education. 	No I haven't. 	It's a nice concept. I participated in the de_mirage2 playtest and it was great fun learning from other more skilled players and seeing the map in its raw state and gaining a little insight in mapmaking. Haven't participated more then that tho.	It's another great concept. I've learned some valuable stuff scrolling though some of the threads and it is nice to have a place for all those questions that might not deserve their own post or simply doesn't get enough attention for a answer in the new category.	I'm a dude from Denmark. I'm currently studying Information science at the university of Copenhagen. I like video games as a hobby and the pursuit of becoming better at it. CSGO is a great game with its competitive edge and I get a sense of accomplishment from it like no other game. I am currently at MGE rank and started playing counter strike back in the 1.6 days. I'd like to think of myself as a nice fellow who thinks before he acts. A guy who judges himself before others and has a healthy sense of self-criticism.  I'd like to become a mod and get some responsibilities and earn some respect in our gaming community so I might become a better person and gamer. I might also be more productive with my Reddit time as I use a lot of time on here (15 hours last week).  	13-18 months	I really like the forum. It is the best on the internet when it comes to discussing the game. I like how the mods are civil and bring concepts like the above mentioned offers to the table. There is some issues like the blatant circlejerk and opinionated downvoting, but all in all it is a great place for discussion and socializing. 
5/30/2015 20:59:57	http://reddit.com/user/cpt_andu/	GMT-5	18	I practiced writing Java for a year in high school, but that was all.	No, but I do have experience with sports officiating, which is similar.	I don't know much about it, but it sounds cool.	Good way for aspiring players to learn more about the game.	My name is. I like games such as CS:GO, Pokémon, and Sumashu Brothers. I am very considerate of other people. I do not smoke or drink alcohol. I am learning to speak Japanese. I am a college sophomore. I check the /r/globaloffensive every day, including the New section, so I already am doing a part of the moderating job.	10-12 months	I love how active it is. News gets out fast, which makes it reliable. I believe there could be less amateur frag videos, such as someone posting a 4k all headshots or something. No one needs to see it, as they are all the same. It's another thing if it's from a professional match, and if that's the case, all highlights such as clutched rounds and pentakills should be all put in one video. 
5/30/2015 21:00:15	http://reddit.com/user/checkmate-9	UTC+2	24	I have basic experience in HTML and CSS as they teached that during my apprenticeship for the past 2 years. Javascript has been entering my life lately (~4 weeks) as I am beginning to work for my fathers company and learning the language. 	Haven't hosted any CS:GO servers. Would be eager to learn though as I am quite interested in anything IT. 	I have taken part in the EU Community Nights for about 4-5 times and had a lot of fun each time. The organisation is quite comfortable even though the mumble server keeps overflowing with users. The rather open process of picking the players does however result in some pretty onesided matches.	Haven't taken part enough to comment.	My name is Lukas "Luke" Gardner. I'm 24 and live in southern Germany. English shouldn't be a concern as I am part British part German and have been growing up speaking English to my parents since forever.  CS has been a part of my life since around 2007 when I started playing 1.6 (never touched Source). I play a lot of matchmaking with my friends and until recently have been subscribed to ESEA (cancelled due to the recent client update). In CS I pride myself as being a very friendly player as you seem to always have the most fun matches when being on a server with other friendly people.   I have been part of readmore.de's moderator team for a little over a year and have enjoyed it a lot. Thats how I got the idea to apply for /r/globaloffensive (and the stickied reminder thread). The CS part of the community can be compared to HLTV.org's, as there is a lot of CS elitism that I personally never got behind. Although on readmore we moderate more thoroughly and strict than on HLTV.org. The site is tiny in comparison though, so the moderating part is not a lot of work. You kind of moderate as you go along surfing the site.   Another passion in my life has to be football (or soccer, though calling it that is sacrilege on my part). As a season ticket holder for VfB Stuttgart I have been through the hell that is the relegation battle this season, and barely made it. Playing the sport on a weekly basis also keeps me fit.   Looking forward to hear from you and hfgl with the search. 	2-3 years	Apart from the usual Reddit type commenting you get like overusing jokes (e.g. the Flusha.gif) I rather like the community. It's a good mix of some oldschool players that always like to enlighten some users of Counter-Strikes 1.6, which I personally adored, and a lot of new blood (A LOT). For me it's by far the best community in CS at the moment. I also am a moderator for one of Germanys biggest eSport Sites (readmore.de). 
5/30/2015 21:02:03	https://www.reddit.com/user/QuantumNebulae	GMT-4	16	I have a short understanding in HTML, JavaScript, and Lua. I've went through close to all tutorials on code academy at least once. I would like to get into coding more, and I'm taking a JavaScript course in my next year of secondary school.	I own a teamspeak server, so I know how to control a group. I have never been an admin on a CS:GO server, but I still help the admins and mods out a lot, I help catch cheaters and relay community feedback to them.	I love the idea of community night, but I've never taken part. It lessens the gap between redditors, and makes the community a better place!	I like Newbie Thursday, as it has helped a lot of people.	I'm a 16 year male, I live in Canada, Ontario. I'm currently attending secondary school, and I am earning excellent grades. I am unemployed, but I am looking for a job so I can save up for post secondary school. School is my #1 priority, and I would like to become a theoretical physicist one day. I've been playing CS:GO for close to a year, with 700 hours total, and counting. I've achieved a rank of MG1. 	7-9 months	I love the community on Reddit for CS:GO. Although there are some people that are trolls, overall the community is a great place to come and hangout. Everyone is usually very supportive and helpful.
5/30/2015 21:03:44	http://reddit.com/u/smellydagger	GMT-4	14	I have practiced Javascript, C++ and c# for the past three years, as a hobby both inside and outsude of school. 	I havr been moderator of multiple Garry's mod and Minecraft servers with roughly 300 people.	While I dont perdonally care for it, I definently see the appeal and am glad it can help the community.	I think it is stellar in both concept and execution, if a little repitive. A more extensive FAQ would likely be helpful.	I am just a teenager looking to he helpful to the growth of a large video game/eSports community. Video games are honestly my passion, as is programming, and being able to manage something still contributing to something I enjoy so mich, and I use reddit every day anyway. I might as well help while Im at it, right?	13-18 months	Over time, I feel this subreddit has been decaying in quality. While being reptitive is common in growing subreddits, I feel as though its prevention is hoth nessicary and possible.
5/30/2015 21:06:11	http://reddit.com/u/happy_mcstabby	UTC-4	15	Yes, I have an alright amount of css and html experience through editing jailbreak tweaks and doing code academy. I've also finished the code academy course in javascript but I by no means am amazing at it.	No I don't unfortunately.	I think it'd be cool if it was every Friday or Saturday instead. I've never participated in community night so I don't have any other suggestions.		I'm very new to the cs community. I bought csgo a bit over a year ago. After my first ten competitive wins I ranked at silver 1(Csgo was my first pc fps) I slowly climbed the rankings, reading guides and such on reddit was very helpful in my attempts to improve. About 8 months of competitive play I'm at MGE, and I'm absolutely hooked on the game. /r/GlobalOffensive really helped me improve myself as a player, and I'd love to give back to the community. I know my application is one of very many and my chances of being accepted are very slim, but I really do have a passion for this game, and I'd love to help keep our reddit community thriving. I have plenty of free time to commit to helping moderate the sub. 	4-6 months	I love the community. /r/GlobalOffensive was a huge help for me when I first started playing csgo. I really don't even notice the moderation of the sub. That's a good or bad thing depending on how you feel subreddits should be moderated. I personally think the moderation is fine right now.
5/30/2015 21:10:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/nuer228/	GMT+1	20	Some HTML experience. Made my own website a couple of years ago and was able to solve most problems without any help. No experience in other areas atm.	Admin on several CS 1.6 servers(public ones) - banning cheaters for the most part.  Also admin on a populated Garry's Mod RP server where I had to help people all the time.	A cool way for the reddit community to come together and make new friends. I haven't taken part as of yet.	Learning something new every time.	I spend most of my time on this sub while not playing the actual game......I guess you can call me a nerd.  I use my PC a lot so you'll see me online quite often.   Would love to go pro some day :P.....if ever.	4-6 months	Love the community, especially when you meet some of the members in-game. Leads to a lot of fun every time.
5/30/2015 21:10:53	http://reddit.com/u/Feral_Goon	GMT-6	22	Computer science major currently working on degree. Programming in Java and html for 5+ years. By no means an expert. 		I think community nights are a great resource for new maps, encouraging community growth, and networking with people you actually want to play with. 	Newbie Thursdays are excellent for new players. When I started reading those threads, I learned quite a bit that I wouldn't have thought about otherwise. 	I know you are looking for different time zones, but I work nights. In my time zone, I work 6p to 3a, which is 12a to 9a GMT. My job is also very laid back, and I would be able to moderate while there if needed. Most nights I watch professional games, then Netflix when the NA scene ends for the night. Moderating would give me something useful to do. I am very unbiased about decision making. I've never been accused of abusing any power I've had. I was actively involved in student and organizational governments throughout my educational career. 	4-6 months	
5/30/2015 21:11:53	http://reddit.com/u/theblakeassociation	GMT+0	16	I completed a computing As level, so basic understanding of Pascal and some self taught HTML	Not much in CS:GO, the odd bunny hop server or surf server. Most of them were very small communities and the owner couldn't afford to fund them anymore.  I have a lot more experience in Minecraft, I can't remember the IP or communities but I also used to host Minecraft servers.	I like the concept, yet I still am to turn up to one. I am also slightly put off by the fact that lower ranks turn up. I wasn't sure if skill ability was split up in games, if it is, I will turn up more.	I think Newbie Thursday is great, I haven't participated in as many as I would like due to work, however on my old reddit account (O-J-Carton which is now deleleted) I participated in much more.	I am a 16 year old from the UK. I play basketball for a national league team and used to play competitive tennis before I quit. I went through a rough patch last year, which encouraged me to pick up cs, ever since then it has been my life.  I am currently in my first year of college (As), studying Maths, Further Maths, Physics and computing, with the goal of going to Cambridge for physics or engineering (fingers crossed).   What else is there about me? I am 6'4.5", not that it matters, just felt I should say it. I am not blessed in the common sense field (accidentally microwaving my phone was not a proud moment). Then again, who learns without making mistakes?  Anyway, that's about the thick of it.  TL;DR: 16 yr old lanky guy with no common sense who loves cs.	13-18 months	I love the GlobalOffensive community, however, it can also be incredibly cancerous if not carefully monitored. One example of this is the witchhunting that happened.  On the flipside (get it?), supporting charities, disabled streamers and setting up awesome projects by working together is something truly amazing to be part of.
5/30/2015 21:21:11	https://www.reddit.com/user/FizzOrFeed/	GMT-7	19	No, I unfortunately do not.	No, I unfortunately do not.	Im personally a fan of Community Night. I, myself, have met a good number of people I consider to be friends to this day through CN. Some of the Maps are, well, less than great at times, but other than that its great. 	This was huge for me and my friends when first really learning the game. Even up until a few months ago I was still asking questions (Though at times from an alt for fear of humiliation). Plus, even just browsing the posts each time they pop up are interesting. People ask questions I had never even thought of, and actually end up being extremely helpful when it comes to bettering myself as a player.	Im 19. I currently work in Cable Installation / Termination, and ive been playing video games since I was a kid. I love all forms of music, but Hip-Hop has to be my favorite (You can always find me on /r/hiphopheads). I attend concerts more than most people fill their car with gas.  I have a terrible sleep schedule (From work, games, concerts and a variety of other things) and am always awake. Im up from basically 4:30am to 1:30am the next day without rest.   I used to play League, but have since stopped and switched to other games. I found with league, I couldnt play anything else. Something about the game was just making me a shitty person. I would get super salty over nothing and wouldnt even touch other steam games (I have over 300). But since switching to GO "full time" Ive been able to branch out much more.   I enjoy writing, though im not always the best. I have an alt account for submissions on /r/WritingPrompts. I have a love for playing Devils Advocate, and im extremely opinionated at times, yet willing to be open minded.   Im not exactly sure how to explain that better, but ill try. I am passionate about anything I do, and am willing to argue over it, if I truly feel im right. But as with anything in life, theres a time and a place to bickering, and even though my opinions are so strong, im rarely if ever, closed minded. If someone brings up a valid point, my opinion is often altered, even if just slighty. Countless times, ive had my opinion completely changed based off one persons response, to my initial thought.   I have no idea what im even saying anymore, but I feel like Its getting way too long so I suppose ill end it there.	13-18 months	Well, in all honesty, its the best community ive seen in such a large gaming subreddit. People arent always helpful, and reddit is still reddit, but for the most part things are pretty smooth.   The other subs I browse the most end up usually being full of toxicity and hate (League, NBA, etc.) but if anyone ever has a question, its answered. Even if it takes a few sarcastic remarks in the process to get there.   I like that more "Shitposts" are getting popular. Now, im not saying 9/10 of the top posts should be bad puns and horrible Microsoft Paint edits, but its still refreshing to see at times. It helps the Sub feel more, human and real, as apposed to a strictly structured hub for CS:GO News and Updates.
5/30/2015 21:32:22	http://reddit.com/u/ssoulle	GMT+1	25	I can make sense of things like HTML, XML and SQL amongst other things but don't actually code myself as it doesn't really interest me.	I have rented and admined servers for CS 1.6, Minecraft and a couple of other minor games purely for a small group of friends to use over the last decade or so. I also ran a 10-20 person Ventrilo server for about 4 years.	I think it is a great place for like minded Redditors to meet and play in a fairly Casual environment. I like the fact that players of drastically different skill levels and play together in a better environment than say a Casual game.   Also, I have discovered some great user created maps through Community Night which I probably wouldn't be aware of. 	Newbie Thursday is good, I think there are probably more people answering questions than asking them.  I think the subreddit needs more "Newbie friendly" content. I remember seeing that most of the users were DMG plus in a user poll. The subreddit can be quite elitist / unfriendly to lower ranked players at times and Newbie Thursday is the right step forward to bridging that gap. The demand is obviously there because the most viewed CS:GO videos online are always tutorials.	I am a 25 year old UK based IT infrastructure / application support analyst who has played Counter Strike on and off since 1.5. I work long hours usually from home and because my job is rather passive in nature, I have alot of downtime to fill. My background is in support so I am very used to interacting with people in a professional and neutral manner.  I usually play with a small group of friends that I have known a long time on a real life basis. I picked up CS:GO in June 2014 and often watch tournaments and play community servers. My accounts are DMG and Eagle if that matters to anyone.	10-12 months	The community on the whole is fairly decent for a subreddit of GlobalOffensives' size, although I don't really look at /r/new all too often so maybe my opinion isn't very accurate. I have noticed the ammount of OC has dropped in favour of Youtube videos and GIFs in 2015. Also CS:GO related drama seems to be creeping into the subreddit more, but I think this is a general reddit trend.   To be honest, I very rarely notice the moderation, which in my opinion is a good thing. It doesn't appear to come across as heavy handed and I have only actually indirectly been involved with a moderator once.
5/30/2015 21:25:00	http://reddit.com/u/Typodestoyer	UTC-5	16	My experience with programming is rather limited to C++, but I have also dabbled in (very basic) Python and Haskell. As to the extent of my programming capabilities, my course finishes this year in 3 weeks so I know most of the key elements. I'd like to think that I am a good problem-solver when I program and that I am ambitious; for example, I made Tetris in C++ with a few of my friends. Not that this is very applicable :P	Nope! :(	I tried to go to one, but I left because I was too confused. I didn't know if the time was when we were supposed to show up or if that was when the games started, I didn't know how the games were organized (how I'd get into one), etc etc etc. It also isn't at the best time for me, as I like my sleep, but it has to allow for everyone so it's understandable.	I am very grateful for Newbie Thursday, because it gives me a great opportunity to ask those who are more experienced about how to improve. Even though I'm a DMG, I know that there are still many ways in which I, quite simply, suck. I think that it is a valuable way to condense threads from over the course of a week and to remind people to ask for help.	Well.Where to begin?  First and foremost, let me say that I have a hard time writing this. On one hand, I don't want to sound cocky and have a really fucking annoying attitude. On the other hand, I don't want to underrepresent myself. I'll try to just state the facts.  I'm 16 years old, and I go to my town public school which has 2000 kids. I'm among the smartest in my grade, especially regarding math. As a sophomore (this year), I took BC Calc and got over 100% in the class. I have no trouble saying I'm smart, but I don't usually tell people stuff like this; when possible, I try to hide that I'm in calc, because I don't want people to feel stupid or to idolize me. Whenever I talk about myself, I try to be humble; however, being a mod is something I desire, and I need to balance honestly with humility in this case.  My history with CS:GO is rather short, actually. I picked up my copy in early December, as I wanted to buy it while it was on sale, and I wasn't sure how to explain buying Steam games to my relatives. I began as a Silver II, and I was ecstatic; having had Silver I friends, I was glad that I was not the worst, even for my first first-person shooter. Having been no stranger to Reddit, I used the reddit frequently; I didn't use the Newbie Thursday posts because I felt that getting better was pretty straightforward; it was clear what I sucked at. And I got better, and yea, #DMGlife.   My strength lies in my straightforward passion for getting things done. For example, I used to play Minecraft. CS:GO has actually caused me to drop it for the most part (more fun :P). When I played, there was a point on a server where there was a subreddit, but the mods were inactive and so was the leadership of the actual place it was made for. In order to reinvigorate the community and cause new discussion, I set up a new subreddit with no prior experience and quickly got it underway. I also set up how new stuff would happen in a sort of communist way. Recently, I stepped down because of my general inactivity with Minecraft.  I am just trying to paint a picture of the kinda guy that I am. I don't know what else to say, honestly. My strength is to make sure that the stuff that needs to get done gets done. Being on the East Coast and in highschool, I'm not really a standout candidate, and I understand that. I do have a question, however. It appears that, when I looked at the rules, there are a lot of types of posts which are "not allowed" but get through anyway. I feel that the rules should be more clearly defined such that they *can* be followed to the T. My question is just how do you choose what's allowed if the rules are so often ignored (see section 3 with stuff like gifs of ragdolls and scoreboards from hackers and "Happy birthday JW" and ESEA bluescreen and chat screenshots from scammers)? That's all. I feel like that's the kinda thing that I would do good work on- making sure the wiki is flushed out, dealing with post that don't follow *better* rules :P not that the rules aren't good, but they aren't dependable. etc. Doing consistent work is my strength. So yea.  That was only *mildly* tangential. I tried to give an impression of who I am, because I don't know what qualifications would make me better suited for this job. I just know that I do my work and work thoroughly for an end result. Hope I didn't use *too* much of your time. Get back to doing mod stuff! :P	7-9 months	I think that everyone is overly critical of everyone else. People yell at each other for circlejerking, fanboying, complaining, sharing their opinion and so on. People need to realize like two things: one, people are not defined by their opinions so don't insult them for one which they hold, and two, "reddit" does not all have one opinion and you cannot generalize us like that.  Out of everything, the most important thing to realize is when to stop arguing. People on /r/globaloffensive are not the best at it. There's a point in an argument about 2-3 comments in where I just say "Here's my point. I'm done arguing. I'm not replying to this comment. Feel free to get the last word." This comes from the fact that people absolutely hate to be wrong and will argue over the most insignificant things so that they're not technically wrong. For doing this, I've been called a coward, but in the end it saves everyone's time. I just hope people learn to do stuff like this more often, because the community loves arguing. (Bit of a tangent, sorry)

I can't really say much as I am never home when they are being held, although I would like to play them.	I do enjoy reading through the advice looking for stuff I can apply to my game play.	mg2 scrub from NZ with hopes of getting into the Australian/New Zealand semi pro scene, like I said in the above reply, I'm more of a lurker but I frequently browse the new and rising sections.	7-9 months	For the most part I like the community, there is a handful of jerks out there, but its nice to see that the community is welcoming to the new players that are being brought in due to the game getting more and more popular, after being in a community like world of tanks that is very hostile towards newer/not so good players its like a breath of fresh air, although I am more of a lurker than a poster I am very much enjoying being part of this community.
5/30/2015 21:28:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/pei_cube/	GMT-4	23	i am a computer science student in university, i can string together some things together in java/javascript/ HTML i understand the basics. given time i can put something together but i wouldnt call any of it good or reusable.	nope	never on around NA commmunity night, 	love it, best regular part of the sub.	comp sci major, looking for a job which would affect moderating probably, usually on between 9pm-(4-7am) ish local time or 1-11am GMT. i play video games and study compsci/physics all of which i do at my computer. i am unavailable between 3pm and 7pm most days as that is when i see friends, do shit.   i play video games, i watch cs, i learn stuff in school and i like whiskey. thats about it.	7-9 months	generally pretty great, ive had some great conversations. there are some people who are just regularly a dick but never to the point that i feel offended just sometimes angry.   the biggest way ive seen it change is i feel like the bigger it gets the more people just want everyone to answer their questions and dont want to go find the answer, and its more noticable to see major topics get insane amounts of different posts.
5/30/2015 21:29:57	http://reddit.com/user/Shades2K	GMT-5	18	I've coded quite a bit with LUA when I owned/hosted my own servers for Garry's Mod back in 2012-2013.  I've played around with HTML a while back, but never got into it, and it faded off.   But I am interested in learning a lot more languages. 	I've administrated my own Garry's Mod server for several years and did maintenance for other servers in the past.  I've also administrated several Teamspeak servers and I was a Community Moderator for a first person shooter game that came out a few years ago called "Nether". It lately died off due to all the cheaters and VAC not working properly and I later retired from that position. When I was the Community Moderator I had to monitor server dozen game servers to check for blatant cheaters/hackers and exploiters.	No comment.	I really think it's a great idea to help people that knew nothing about the game. 	I love to play games, mainly Counter-Strike, Rust. I have a big interest in improving my Counter-Strike game and later hoping to move up levels in ESEA later on in the year(s).  I also have a big interest in Survival games.  I have a huge steam account, level 100, 2,000+ CSGO items, and a big trader within the trade community. www.steamcommunity.com/id/shades2k    (Rather not get to personal)	4-6 months	I've seen a handful of trolls but besides that I think it's a friendly clean environment apart from the trolls I've seen. 
5/30/2015 21:34:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/DeadFlyingBird/	GMT-5	17	None. However, I tried learning Lua, but I had no more free time on my hands, I didn't get very far.	I was never a mod for a CSGO server, however I was a staff member on a GMOD TTT Server, and staffed it for at least 1 year, before I had to resign due to me being burned out. I earned the highest position on the server, and tried to help out everyone, deciding applications, talk to the owners about new changes to the server. The community was great! Lots of friendly people who would try to help new players, and just keeping a great environment to play with.	None. I've never participated.	I like it, it helps new players get answers about their questions. :)	I'll admit i'm not very active regarding commenting to threads, i'm a lurker. Been lurking for 6 months, pretty much. However, i'll be sure to help out people regarding questions with the game, or anything else really, if I could. I currently attend highschool, and I want to have a job dealing with computers. I love gaming, and love helping people. May you have a great day.	4-6 months	I believe that the community gets outraged at some stupid things (Like the new operation right now). And I found that the whole flusha cheating thing stupid.
5/30/2015 21:35:19	http://reddit.com/u/VortexRyan	GMT-8	16	HTML and CSS, I have taken courses on both subjects, although, I am not 100% comfortable with reddit's CSS.				Hello! My name is Ryan, and I am a 16 year old kid residing in Oregon. I have been playing CS:GO for a little over a year and am currently at MG2 rank. I have been teaching some of my friends the workings of CS and helping to get them into the game, even my girlfriend. (She's pretty trash. Don't tell her I said that.) I'm currently a Sophmore at my high school, taking a few business classes and web designing classes. (where I got my  HTML and CSS knowledge.) I hope you guys like my application and think I am worthy of a position on your moderation team. Thank you for taking the time to read through all of these, and have a good day!  (I speak fluent english too, forgot to mention that earlier, sorry.)	10-12 months	The community is quite well organized and polite, although, it would be nice to see some more serious posts and not just humor posts.

I have +1.300 hrs in cs:go and am currently a Global Elite, but don't really play that much mm tbh.  I play for a german team called Semper Paratus and play in the german ESL Season. I have placed first with my team in the Plantronics Cup 1 germany 2015. and 3rd in the 2nd CUP.  I am an outgoing personality, work good in a team and love to help others, as well as wrecking people (cs winner mentality sry ^^).  I am on my computer alot since i am at university and lets be honest lectures can be pretty boring.  To my hobbies outside of CS, i am a movie & TV geek (MCU & game of throns) and an avid fitness enthusiast, as well as enjoy going out.

5/30/2015 21:37:59	http://reddit.com/u/SimonTheCrab	GMT-5	17	I have 2 years of html experience. I took 3 classes on basic computer science learning html, I am a decent coder when using html.	I haven't been an administrator on any CS:GO servers but I have moderated 3 Minecraft servers a few years back before I quit the game. I took basic responsibilities into my hands to keep the community friendly and happy.	I think it is a great idea.	Newbie Thursday is extremely helpful. I love how the community gets together and helps each other out.	I'm 17, graduating high school in less than a month. I love video games, collecting action figures, The Walking Dead, WWE, NHL, fishing, hunting, snowmobiling and my cat.	7-9 months	I like the community. The only part I really don't like are all of the workshop skins being submitted to the subreddit.
5/30/2015 21:39:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/Yaspan/	GMT-7	42	G-code used in CNC programming and a variant of C+ used to make scripts for industrial automation	No none 	Awesome, have participated in a few of them, like testing maps as well	Well helping out newcomers to the game should be ongoing, I think it is something that should be stickied 247/	Huge gamer nerd or maybe I should say CS nerd because I really do not play much else and have been this way since CS came out 16years ago.   I spend a fare amount of time on Reddit Global Offensive as well as on Steam Powered User Forums, maybe a bit more than I should lol, I love talking about game and finding out new things. I get a bit distracted by it at work  but fortunately I am on flex time at work so I can always make the time up. I work in product development as a mechanical designer.	19-24 months	Fickle, but generally most people are positive but act sometimes as a hive mind, and if the mind gets negative at any time the community becomes pretty toxic
5/30/2015 21:44:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/_Chelsy/	UTC-8	17	No.	I have zero experience with admining CS:GO servers.	I think community night is extremely fun! It allows redditors to come together and enjoy their free time with strangers. In addition, people like subreddits that interact with each other more, especially in the game.	I don't frequent Newbie Thursday, but I do think it is helpful. It's like r/leagueoflegends weekly thread; it's great for people to ask questions especially since CS:GO is getting many new friends.	I'm 17 years old with an interest in gaming. I like to be a leader and help people, especially in CS:GO. Even though I'm only MG2(sad life), I help new people and defend people who are being victimized. I don't go out much because I only have a few friends, so I'm pretty active allowing me to lurk the subreddit frequently. I like to read manga and listen to a lot of music when I'm not gaming. I also love to watch the tournaments for CS:GO. P.S. I'm not a girl; Chelsy is just the name of my favorite singer :). Thanks for reading buds!	4-6 months	I think the /r/GlobalOffensive community is fine as it is now! Our subreddit has a lot of variety content, with frag movies, SFMs, discussion threads, cool plays, and the meta. I do think there should be more discussion threads however on bigger matches(post-match discussions, though the weekly ESEA one is good too).
5/30/2015 21:44:15	http://reddit.com/u/elinger_	GMT-3	16	I know HTML(5), CSS, JS, a good handful of JS libraries including Node and jQuery, as well as know a good amount of Go.  I've also done a good amount of HTML/CSS only transitions.	None experience doing this whatsoever.	I really enjoy community night, but I do feel like there needs to be more moderator presence in the mumble when it's happening. It feels like, to me at least, that right after the first round of games is over, everyone just kind of is like "If anyone wants to play a game, head over to X server", and while I don't have a problem with that whatsoever it's just kind of a pain to get a game going when the person that wanted to start the game is in charge of deciding the map, and a lot of the time they want to play an obscure or non-default community map that takes a LOT of time to download to people's PCs because of how slow the upload on the community night servers are. Other than this, I love community night, I think it's a lot of fun	The only thing I want to state about Newbie Thursday is that I remember back when I first started playing CS:GO, the only weapon I used (like a lot of members I'd think) is the P90, which I used for quite a long time until I realized my wrongdoing. I think along with all the other FAQ questions that are in the weekly Newbie Thursday post, there should be a Q/A saying why you should use rifles over SMGs for your primary gun rounds. Maybe link to the recoil master map if that would help, I know that helped some of my Silver friends a lot when they first started playing.	I started playing CS in February (I think?) when it was gifted to me by someone on reddit surprisingly enough. Since then I've taken breaks here and there to focus on different things that needed to be attended to, but I never really stopped playing at all. I'm currently MG1 in MM, and also play ESEA/CEVO a fair bit. I have pretty awful internet that spikes my ping from 90 (what I play MM with) to about 190 here and there, but never get any spikes on ESEA or CEVO, only insane packet loss :P. I'd like to blame my lack of skill on my net solely, but that's not the truth at all, lol.  When I get better internet and I get better, I'd like to join an Open team of some kind and hopefully compete. I won a local LAN where I live with my mix team consisting of a bunch of guys that I had never met that we formed when we met at the LAN center. To be fair, I don't think the competition was very good, but it was still a great experience to play on LAN and be in a team-environment.  I like to code websites through client work and edit fragvideos in my spare time. I just started doing fragvideos again after a long hiatus from making CoD fragvideos way back when (sorry) and enjoy basically just getting better at what I like to do. This includes programming, CS, and editing fragvideos.  Thanks for reading my application, I really enjoyed filling this out :).	7-9 months	Having been a member of this sub for a good amount of time, I'd like to think I've seen it evolve a fair bit. One of the things I see a lot less of now is toxicity in the community compared to a while ago surprisingly enough. And I think the reason that is, is because there has been such a large boost in the player-base of GO that we have more of the general pop. of reddit chiming in, saying what they think about things, and when you have more people discussing a topic in a civilized manner, you have a lot more people with the right idea about things. To nurture this presence of positivity, I think one of the things the mods could do that they haven't done in the past is deleting the multiple threads that are created when something big happens in the community, so that there's more opinions stuck in the same jar so to speak, that have to debate their sides and thought processes. This would discourage toxic members of the community from posting, as well as encourage people to start of the conversation on the right foot when they head into a new thread that's just been posted. Just my two cents regarding the topic of repeat threads.
5/30/2015 21:47:07	http://reddit.com/u/xXNyanCatXx1234qwert	UTC-4	14	No, but am willing to learn	No sadly, but am willing to learn	It's a great way to show the opinions of other on important subjects. 	It helps the people who know less about the game, improve and make the community more educated on it as a whole. 	I'm a little talkative, but only speak when spoken to. Although I'm quite young, I'm a fast learner, espically at cs. I'm willing to do anything to benefit others. I browse 4-6pm on and off, (time zone above) and browse more from 9:30-12:00 I'm willing to extend my time on Reddit if needed. If I were to be a mod, I'd have to hold off until July 1st or so. I'm currently building a pc and will have it done around then. I have high respect for the cs community and if I don't make it, I would like a message saying so. If you're more interested, if you message me I can give you a contact email. 	4-6 months	It's a pretty good community, mods do what they're supposed to and no more, plenty of different subjects are discussed, and lots of people learn about CS as a whole. 
5/30/2015 21:48:36	https://www.reddit.com/user/modgone/	GMT+3	20	I learned the basics in HTML and CSS and Python but never actually created something amazing.	I have no experience with CS:GO servers, I hosted back in 2006-2008 a CS Source server but that was pretty much it with Counter-Strike Servers.	Sadly I never attended a Community Night yet so I can't say much on this topic.	I think its a great way for the community to have their questions answered in a single thread, without flooding the subreddit with single topic submissions.	I'm from Romania, finished high-school last year, took a year off ,after 12 years of studying  and this year I'll join a University and study law or media ( advertising ).  I have a lot of experience with players/community of players, I had a raiding guild in WoW for a few years then I was an admin on a WoW Private server for 2 years and I helped with mentaining the server and their forums.  This being said, I have a lot of time on my hands in the coming months and I definitely can help the community if its needed.  	7-9 months	I like the community overall, people are friendly and helpful.The only thing I can complain about is people posting their advertising their workshop skins , it seems pretty unfair.  
5/30/2015 21:59:48	http://reddit.com/u/outypoo	GMT+1	17	Yes, studied software development in college and that tought me JavaScript and some Python, I also took it upon myself to learn a little HTML/CSS	A long while ago I used to be a co owner of a chain of minecraft servers, each with multiple plugins that I had to maintain and also moderate while in-game.  I've also been an admin on Gmod Dark-RP(Zarp gaming) which used to be extremely popular but I left.(the owner sold it and i didn't like where it was going) 	I love the idea of a community night where everyone can get together and chill especially on a new map to play test, however I don't like how it's carried out practically. 	I think this is a great idea, however I also think on the post it should include major points from last newbie Thursday to let people go and have a look.  Maybe some sort of FQA of noob questions?	I'm a 17 year old English student, I'm extremely invested in CS:GO and would actually say it's a major hobby and might be border lining obsessive haha.  I'm quite mature, however I do like to make a joke every now and then.   I hope you consider me, I dont often see EU mods on the sub reddit also	7-9 months	Personally I think the community is quite a lot to take in, but once you get settled in you start to recognize names and all that.  I don't like how the same post is posted every few hours about a broken game mechanic though, but I tend to ignore them.  The community could be less toxic; I don't think it's that much of a problem though
5/30/2015 22:18:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/XilentDota/	GMT+2	19	I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, Javascript, and C++. I can code a simple page, but im not an expert in any.	Never been an admin is CS:GO, although i have done this for Dota	No real thoughts	For me personaly, as someone who got into CS:GO about 8 months ago, they were very usefull e.g. in setting up an autoexec.	My name is Sjors, a 19y.o. dutch guy with a passion of gaming and Esports. I used to be a hardcore/semi-pro CoD player for 6 years on the PS3 until i discovered PC gaming. Here i stated playing Dota 2 (hence the Dota tag in my Reddit name) and a lot of indie games. Besides gaming I like to sport and go out with friends.   As final words id like to say I like the community and would love to make it even better. Also thank you for your consideration!  Cheers, Sjors "XilentDota"  ps I also have a non dota reddit account http://www.reddit.com/user/7urtleKnight/ if the name would be a problem ;)	7-9 months	Very helpful if someone needs help. Also memes get spread fast, which is a thing i like a lot about the cs:go community.  Still there can be a lot of recurring themes like the ladder bug, hitboxes etc. Sometimes i think 2 videos is enough to inform me of the bug and 2 threads of discussion with kinda the same arguments seems to be more than enough. 
5/30/2015 22:06:13	http://reddit.com/u/DQuest99	UTC-5	16	I have some small amounts of experience in HTML/CSS coding from a High School course that taught this content. I also have some experience in C# from several years ago, when I was part of the modding community surrounding an indie title, Terraria.	I don't have any experience in administration of CS:GO servers, however, I was an admin in SolarPvP, a sizable minecraft server from ~2 years ago. I am also an (inactive) moderator of Odyssey PVP, a steam group related to playing PVP-based minigames for Terraria.	Community night seems like a really cool way to chill with fellow redditors, test new maps, and just have fun playing competitively outside of matchmaking or alternate PUG services. However my experience with it is very limited, as throughout the school year i've been required to be in bed, or at least off of the computer, by 9:00 PM.	Newbie Tuesday is an awesome concept that allows the community members to learn from one another in a constructive environment, and i've walked away from newbie tuesdays learning a few things myself.	Oh jeebus. I'm rather bad at social stuff, especially telling about myself, but i'll try... My name is Isaac, and I live on the East Coast of NA. Outside of Counter-Strike, i'm an active member and student at a local musical studio, currently taking lessons for voice. In school I have taken a mix of honors and AP classes, however last year was very difficult to me for personal reasons that I don't mind talking about further if the mod team wishes to know. Back into CS, i've been playing since the time of ESL One Colonge, though i've had the game since last February. It's basically been my life ever since :P Due to struggles with depression and anxiety, i've always needed some form of escape, and i'm thankful that for me, it can be an amazing game like CS:GO rather than drugs or self harm. I'm getting off topic... but there's not much more to tell, really, other than that I love this community and want to be an active part in keeping it clean, and growing further as the years go on. People complain about how the game sucks now, but... after the release of CS 1.0, it was almost 4 years (!!!) until the legendary version, 1.6, was released to the public. This game is only going to get better, and I want to be an active part of that.	10-12 months	Where to start... I started following this reddit between the time of ESL One Colonge (when I started playing) and between the so-called "VACenning," where several professional players were banned, as i'm sure you remember. Over the course of my time being active here i've noticed a theme of certain hivemind opinions developing, with those who don't follow these mindsets being berated by their peers. An example of this was actually during the peak of the VACenning related drama, when the community was engaging in a full-on witch hunt against Flusha, or the Fnatic "Olofpass" boost, where the general public opinion was that Fnatic are evil. The /r/GlobalOffensive community also suffers from a loud minority of low-effort text posters, commonly called shitposts by the community. Most of the time, these are only half-entertaining if at all. I don't really have any criticisms or comments on the current mod team. For the most part, they do their job in reasonably timely fashion.
5/30/2015 22:10:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/spitecs	GMT-4	15	I personally projects concerning C++ and C# within a school run group, when I had been assigned to create and produce a game in the Unity Engine, alongside some personally preferred applications. I had also taken the time to receive online courses for HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP, although this had taken place in my last semester so I may need to brush back up on my CSS and PHP. But from what I've experienced, it seems as though CSS will be a primary means of revising and generally editing the subreddit, so I would be more than happy to prioritize it above all else. 	Unfortunately I have never personally moderated an official Counter-Strike server, but rather personally ran and locally distributed ones that I allow my friends to visit in order to play specific game modes not provided to us on official valve servers or on the public ones. We had used a open and free hosting service that required little maintenance, but we have long since abandoned it in order to acquire more skill and a better understanding of the functions behind the Counter-Strike SDK, amongst other things.	N/A	I find it very helpful and necessary for the influx of new players and further developing ones to have such a reliable thread to visit in order to interact with players of varying skill groups. 	Personally, I aspire to pursue new projects concerning the moderation and management of organizations or general communities, due primarily to the support and criticism of my peers. The /r/GlobalOffensive Reddit community seemed like a perfect opportunity to practice and hone this skills, especially among reputable and hopefully positive influences such as the mods and administrators. I would have applied sooner if I hadn't feared that a majority of the staff would view my age as a setback, but I've deceived to prove this conception wrong by providing my personal thoughts and hopefully showing that I am an invested and hardworking individual that will go to almost any length to complete or sufficiently do a task given to me by executives or my higher ups. It would be greatly appreciated if you so much as reviewed and considered me as an option for this position, and I thank you for your time in advance. I'd also like to state that I have used several accounts in an attempt to find a username that would suit me well, and have decided to use this one permanently, so I'm extremely sorry for the lack of activity this account may have seen.	10-12 months	I enjoy the careful and subtle moderation exerted by the current mods, and the loose restrictions set on the users. It makes a very welcoming environment for most. And the lack of negativity I've seen in most posts has surprised me and appears to have only given this community a stronger and respectable reputation. 
5/30/2015 22:11:11	http://www.reddit.com/user/force11air	UTC-6	17	I worked a little with java script, but I probably do not remember to much. I will however be starting college and I have a major in Computer Science.	I once ran a Garry's Mod server. Besides that, it is the only expericen I have.	I have never participated, but I believe it is a great thing and helps strengthen the community.	I feel it is a great way to help new people that may be looking to get more into the competitive scene or just new to the game altogether.	I am 17 and I live Louisiana. I have just started college with a major in Computer Science. I want to start coding and hopefully program video games. In the event that it is not possible, I want to be a software developer.	4-6 months	I feel like the people on /r/GlobalOffensive are very indecisive when it comes to things. I feel like a lot of people throw ideas out or complain about how something needs fixing, but when it actually changes/fixes, they don't seem to be satisfied. They can also be the exact opposite, especially when the witch-hunt for JW was happening. Everyone was so sure he was hacking, but when he didn't everyone forgot about it. All together, it may just be a general Reddit thing, but people on the sub do seem to be critical and know how to evaluate things within the game and I usually lockup to them.
5/30/2015 22:18:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/gramarnotsee	GMT-5	19	Yes, I have knowledge in HTML and a mixture of not so known Java and CSS	Yes. I helped run a few servers in 1.6 as well as Source. Previously ran servers for the quake 3 mod Urban Terror	I think its a great way for people of all skills to get together and have fun playing a game they enjoy	Newbie Thursday is an excellent way to decrease the amount of threads people post asking questions because they are new. It's also a great way to limit the posting of the same question several times. 	I am 19 years old current in EMT school and have been playing since 1.6 (roughly). I played competitively with DC in late 1.6 and early Condition Zero. I am currently attempting to sign with a sponsor to bring a team together for the current Counter Strike game.   Other than being a computer geek I am into the outdoors (fishing, hunting) and am trying to achieve a goal I've had for several years in playing CSGO professionally. 	13-18 months	The current state of the GlobalOffensive community is great. The increased threads that are encouraging people to post questions and receive quick answers has increased through the last few months. Also, the community has in my opinion helped with the increase of the Global Offensive game community as a whole.
5/30/2015 22:26:08	http://www.reddit.com/user/armheat136	UTC-4	17	I have experience with HTML and CSS. I have made a couple websites 	I was an admin on a Minecraft one if that counts XD I would help with there website and wiki. I also helped with bug testing. We used Mumble and IRC.			I'm working on getting my eagle scout with a venturing crew. I love to be out doors and play basketball. I have slowly been getting into computers over the last couple of years.	7-9 months	I feel like it a positive community with friendly people. Who ask questions and like to share highlights from there experiences. With alot of room to grow!
5/30/2015 22:34:08	http://www.reddit.com/user/SKAntoniou/	GMT+0	18	No sorry.	Hosted server for my team and university, setting game rules, making sure everyone can connect and get it working. Playing custom maps. They were hosted on my computer and were turned on with a LAN Ethernet switch box to have a LAN 5 ping setup.	I really like it, I extremely like the fact that you tests people maps. I am a map designer and have been for a while and map testing is one of the most important parts of the process. It also gives people a chance to meet more people in the community (stops constant threads about "MG1 looking for team")	I never really used it.	I am living in the UK studying in university. Played Counterstrike: Source casually, moved onto CS:GO when on sale and haven't stopped playing it. Ranked from silver 4 to DMG. Now I have a background in youtube, (not making my own channel) but I used to work for youtube editing videos for channels putting out 2-3 videos a day and in that process learned a lot about the programs I now use and how the youtube working environment works. Using reddit, I do not usually post unless I think it will contribute to discussion. I do not see the point in saying "LOL" to a post and not expanding the post. I check reddit a few times a day to see what is new. I used to be a high betting man but find that it is more fun to just watch the matches instead. I know every tier 1 team and always know my rankings on them and usually I am right about the outcome of the game, Familiar with tier 2+3 teams, know their name, style they play in, who they recently beat, and most of their player names. I play a lot of PC games and play with 10 of my friends on counterstrike regularly, In this we setup servers, mess around test new maps. Just all round have fun. I am a competitive player but at the moment more interested in getting university friends to join me playing and teaching them this game. I will be attending i55 if you need any help with that and will probably have a press pass from work. Thank you for reading, hopefully my low karma as a lurker wont discourage you from my application. 	19-24 months	I don't even know any more, by my experience, when I joined it, it used to be news and things to help the game. Now it seems as well of that, people just post their "funny videos" shouting at other playing pewdiepie style to get to front page. Also with all that I check "new" quite a bit to see if anything is happening or to help out and people just seem like this is a place to post instead of googling so they can get free karma. I am NOT saying I think it should all go back to news but if something goes to the hot page, maybe force a filter so then people can just ignore what they don't want to see. Also a night mode button would be cool. 
5/30/2015 22:37:22	http://www.reddit.com/user/Loco_Poco_Zombie/	GMT-6	16	Not really any	I have never specifically ran or used csgo servers. I have run 2 competitive TF2 servers in the past. I'm familiar with FTP	I usually try to play when i have the chance which now isn't that much. But when I do play I always give feedback to the developers of the map after a few games. 	Great place to learn new tips about the game. I hope it stays for the future	I go to a lenient school on phone use so its no problem moderating during the day time. I spend most of my time now a days playing csgo. Still a mge noob though. 	7-9 months	to start off its way better the r/dota2. At lot less circle jerk over here and generally a bit nicer towards content. I do feel on someone of the game play clips with less up votes people usually shit all over and are generally assholes to.
5/30/2015 22:40:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/PawhJr/	GMT-4	14	Not much, but I know basic JavaScript and HTML.	I have not. But, I have owned and admined Minecraft servers, Kappa :P.		I love it, I usually don't post anything, but I love to read a lot of things posted so that I can learn and improve.	My life can be summed up in a word, but that would be boring (the word was Counter-Strike). But I am not just a CS:GO player, I play a wide variety (but CS is my most played), everything from Zelda to Borderlands, I play it all. During the school year I do academic competitions and during the summer I mainly focus on video games.  	0-3 months	The basis of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive community is Reddit. It's a place where people from everywhere in the CS:GO universe can collide and interact. Maybe a guy wants to share his new ace for everyone to see, or ask how he can retake Bombsite A on de_example. Well, this is possible on the CS:GO Reddit. I love this community, and that is why I am  applying.
5/30/2015 22:49:36	http://reddit.com/user/Mazey01	GMT+1	16	HTML, Javascript, CSS. I've made websites, nothing too great though (latest project is http://snir-gedasi.com/ PHP have done it the past, could relearn.	Yes, not in CSGO though.	I'm usually not there, most of the time it's over when I see the sticky sadly.	I guess it's quite good, there are all kinds of questions, not just 'newb' questions. People are helpfull and answer any question	I have no idea what to write here, I've rewritten it over 5 times. I'm on mumble daily playing games or talking to a certain community, I follow the CSGO scene and enjoy browsing reddit for anything, if you want to know anything specific, ask me! Thanks for putting your time into reading this	4-6 months	Honestly not much to say, friendly community who like the occasional joke.
5/30/2015 22:55:18	http://www.reddit.com/user/thedoubleygamer	UTC-6	16	I do not.	I have only administrated small servers, never anything too big. I've hosted a view Counter Strike servers for custom maps (Dust 2 Night, Inferno Night, etc.)	I think it's a great way to get the community to interact with each other. It's especially great for those who don't have the resources to play odd community made maps that are sometimes used on Community Nights. 	I think it's a friendly way to get people who are new to Counter Strike into it. A lot of people come from /r/leaugeoflegends or /r/dota2 who know nothing about the game, but because we have these Newbie Thursday threads it gives them a good opportunity to ask, what in their minds, are some silly questions. 	Hi! My name is Matthew, and I'm 16 years old from Iowa in the United States. I've been playing Counter Strike for close to a year now and browsing the subreddit for about 8 months. I've mostly been a lurker on my time on /r/globaloffensive, only posting a few things. Although I am very willing to change to fit the position.   If you have any additional questions, feel free to add me on Steam and ask me anything you would like to know :) http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAmDoubleY	7-9 months	I have always noticed that the community LOVES to contradict itself. To use recent events as an example, some people hate ESEA but will then turn around talking about how great it is. 
5/30/2015 22:53:18	https://reddit.com/user/Nikita_AD	GMT-7	16	No Sorry...............	Nope... Again, Sorry...	Community Night is a great way for players to get involved with each other. I believe it makes our subreddit stronger and helps us bond closer together.	Great program to help beginners.	Ive been playing CS for about 3 years now. i used to game on a Macbook Pro, but recently upgraded to PC! I love playing CSGO and have attended a few of the tournaments. i also met Ninjas in Pyjamas..... That is all...	3-4 years	The community has become more about fixing problems/bugs, and also helping other players with issues that they have either in game or out. Its a great subreddit, 100% better than the Steam guides.
5/30/2015 22:57:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/HoboTheImpaler/	GMT-5	18	No coding experience	I have about a year and a half of experience Moderating/Admining on multiple Garry's Mod servers as well as their respective community forums and teamspeak servers. Game modes like DayZ, RP, TTT, and etc (Most memorable of the communites include ImpactedServers and EthiosGaming)	Things like community night really emphasize that this subreddit and even counter-strike's overall audience is indeed an actual community. although i have yet to be a part of one it is something i have been meaning to participate in. 	I've been a part of the sub for roughly 9 months now and when i joined the sub i was ranked silver 3. When i saw newbie Tuesdays i was intrigued and they were something i would ctrl + v onto a notepad and read over multiple times to help my self learn their contents and now a few month's later I'm moving in and out of LE/LEM Overall i find it fantastic and i'm so glad i was able to use and learn from it.	although my username is HoboTheImpaler i got by TCP everyhwere else (not entirely sure the thought process behind the username)  I own a team that plays ESEA open (fingers crossed for playoffs) and i currently moderate a group on steam by the name of CS:GO Rafflez  Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCursedPlague/  Personal Twitter: Twitter.com/CursedPlague  Others: https://twitter.com/alcatrazcs https://twitter.com/CSGORafflez	7-9 months	As a whole the community is very well informed and has matured greatly over time (in most cases) which is why i find discussion so appealing on the subreddit. Even controversial posts like rumors and roster change related submissions are fun to keep up with because of the in depth discussion about the future of said team as well as the scene overall as opposed to comments like "omg rip skins i hope xxx gets xxx" or something of that manner flooding posts.
5/30/2015 22:57:47	http://www.reddit.com/user/BoppinxB/	GMT-5	21	Working on a Computer Science degree at the moment   strong in JAVA, Python and PHP.  Have experience in HTML and CSS	No	I think its a great idea have participated in only a few. Great way to meet to people to queue up with in competitive	Kinda pointless now, like most questions have been answered in some manner. I think something along the lines of coaching would be a better idea, but have no good idea in how to implement that. Maybe a "Mentor Monday"? 	Obviously I like counter strike. I come and go in spurts with the game. Some weeks i get the itch and log a lot of play time, other weeks I could care less. Other interest include running, reading, app designing. I have never been a moderator before but would love to give it a go, and think i would be pretty decent at it.	7-9 months	For the most part I think its sorta gone down hill since I became active. Its more if a medium for people to complain on. When i first joined it, it was a lot of discussions on pro teams, people cool feats, or something else interesting. Now its main a lot of complain about teh state of the game(don't get me wrong there are bugs that need fixes), or hating new updates.
5/30/2015 22:58:16	https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsTyrrellYo/	GMT+0	21	decent HTML and CSS, js not so great but i can play with it  I created the original stylesheet for /r/twitchplayspokemon in one afternoon and maintained/added to it for about 9 months.	Nope!	I haven't had the opportunity to play on Community Nights due to the start being at 2.30am in my timezone.	I like the idea and have commented in the thread a few times. The only issue I have with it is that despite it being scheduled it seems to be added by two different bots and sometimes an actual human, which is a bit bizarre.	I live just outside Dublin, Ireland and study Civil Engineering. I have been playing csgo in whatever time I could find over the last year and have been visiting the subreddit for about as long. Due to the amount of time and work required by my course, I have not been hugely active in the game but I am striving to improve, after about 310 hours I reached MG1. I also visit the subreddit's IRC channel on quakenet.  I have moderated a few large and active subreddits, including /r/tumblr until a few weeks ago and /r/twitchplayspokemon from its inception until December. I also modded braveryjerk but that doesn't really count.  I speak fluent English and Irish, and have conversational French.  Over the next four months I have a lot more time due to college being over for the year and am willing to moderate the subreddit. I may have to give it up or reduce my activity after that, depending my workload from late September. I also don't mind helping out in a janitorial role in times of extreme activity if necessary, rather than as a full moderator.	10-12 months	It appears to be quite well run with little issues from the outside, whether the community is relatively well-behaved or the moderators are on heavy cleanup is not instantly apparent to me. The content is a bit eclectic but none of it is entirely unwanted, perhaps with the exception of the "look at this skin I just made" posts.
5/30/2015 23:01:55	http://www.reddit.com/user/wild_out/	UTC-4	20	HTML/CSS: about 6 years of informal experience. I won 2nd place in a state web design competition my senior year of high school and I work on private projects weekly.  Javascript: about 1 year of informal experience. I like to make web apps using Javascript to make some personal operations easier.	no experience	I think it's nice. I wouldn't mind participating occasionally but I'm not super excited about it. 	It's a fantastic opportunity to help players new to the game. Many subreddits have something similar and I find that it help to declutter and it serves as a good hub from which to learn and discuss.	My name is Jorge and I'm attending University in Miami. Right now I enjoy DJ'ing, weight lifting, browsing Reddit, playing CS and Dota 2, and going out to party and such.   I have a lot of free time, especially now for the summer. I have moderated unofficial Gears of War forums like 5 years ago, but I have no proof of that. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind doing something positive with my free time.  Hopefully I can help the subreddit continue to be an awesome resource for Global Offensive and build it into something even better. Thank you for reading.	2-3 years	I don't feel strongly about it. Quality has stayed about the same while obviously it's a lot bigger than it was 3 years ago. I still enjoy it.
5/30/2015 23:23:19	https://www.reddit.com/user/SKY-911-/	GMT+4	16	some HTML	yes, in CS i am a admin across many servers,  you'll see most admins abuse their power but tbh you have to warn people first i always give 3 strikes then your out.  http://retakes.splewis.net/   http://csgo1v1.splewis.net/ how did i get admin on that server? i just went on played for months and kept my cool i never had a problem with the server the head admin is cool.		i love it tbh i always asked my question. quickly i got a reply from high ranks willing to help.	sup im SKY-911- im from New york, African American cs go player so far CS:GO is the only thing i play. i started a youtube channel love it. i currently studying I.T when i get outta school ill start repair PC's. yup! we must build the master race! when im not on CS:GO im on this reddit or different sites with my music on chillin 	13-18 months	to be honest its a good sub Reddit but there is many mean guys here.. every community has toxic and bad people but this community has a mix of both good and bad guys
5/30/2015 23:25:44	https://www.reddit.com/user/waterlootint	UTC-5	19	HTML, css, Javascript, c#/++  Currently at University of Waterloo for computer engineering. 	No experience as a CSGO server admin. 	Great events, only been able to participate in one or 2 due to my schedule sadly. 	Love it. I'm fairly active on the threads as it is a great way to provide advice. 	I currently am at university for Engineering. I started Csgo and fell in love, I pretty much always have the Csgo reddit open, either on my phone, laptop or computer even in class :/ I have a strong idea of what constitutes an appropriate comment or post and feel like I could be a valuable asset. Besides gaming my other hobby is car racing. I started racing karts, then progressed to Thunder cars. I actively follow the pro scene in Csgo and through time and passion have a strong understanding of the game and most of its aspects. Thanks for your time :) 	10-12 months	The community on the reddit is great. Way back when cs was a smaller game there was a more small tight knit community feel to it. As it grew the feeling hasn't changed by too much which is great. 
5/30/2015 23:34:59	http://www.reddit.com/user/acoluahuacatl/	GMT+0	20	Yes, I've just finished my second year as CS&IT student - got some basic knowledge of JS, java (though I hate java) and C. I've done a bit of databases, although this was only a single semester with about 50ish hours.	I've helped with running some rcon scripts for MTA:SA (multiplayer of GTA San Andreas) a few years ago on community servers. I have some basic knowledge of CS:GO rcon, but it's nothing exceptional. 	I haven't had the chance to try it out yet and probably won't in the near future, as I very rarely enjoy playing new maps without spending some time on them in an offline mode. However, it feels like a great way of bringing the CS:GO community together and allowing it to have some fun together. It also enables people to get to know each other rather than just recognize their reddit names.	It's another great idea, but I feel like a sticky "FAQ" thread would work a bit better. A lot of the questions are asked every week and the new ones are often omitted due to the amount of questions being asked. Having a sticky could possibly remove some of the questions that are always being asked.	So as I said I'm 20 y.o. IT student. I've been playing CS on and off for the past 6 or 7 years - started off with non-steam cs 1.6 and now I'm somewhat addicted to GO.   I'm usually dedicated to the things I do that I'm interested in. When in my second lastt year of seconday school (high school), I took up athletics I managed to recieve a "club athlete of the year" award the following year. My dedication to the sport was shown by me doing 15+ hrs of training every week - no matter the weather, and that can be pretty terrible here in Ireland.    As part of my uni course I've had to work on several group projects, which taught me how to work in a team quite well. I feel like I could work with the current mod team and help keeping the community positive.   Last but not least, I could carry the /r/go in the next VP staff tournament. We all know that NA global < EU silver!	7-9 months	I feel like the community is allowing way too much racism towards Russians/Germans. We also seem to be allowing certain people, such as Thooorin, get away with too much.   Another thing that somewhat annoys me is seeing some random threads which have next-to-nothing to do with the actual game being upvoted to the front page. Be it the weekly "X made Y this cake!! omgomg!!". There's also a lot of topics which are always finding their way onto the front page - these being "tec9 is op", "hitboxes suck". Yes, these are some serious issues we have in the game, but posting a million threads about it every day won't do anything.  On the positive side, there's plenty of people always willing to help others out. Whenever someone asks for help or an explanation there always seems to be someone to help them out.  A great addition to the sub are the post-match discussion threads. I love seeing them pop up even if I don't read half of them. They allow people to discuss certain aspects of the game and different plays done by the pros.
5/30/2015 23:37:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/Fallens218/	UTC-5	20	Very little. Dream weaver in 10th grade. Nothing special at all. 	Nope			My name is Derek  Nelson 20 years old from Duluth Minnesota. Been playing CS since when CSS released.Unemployed and starting school in september of this year. I play a lot of video games. Also enjoy skateboarding and all that jazz. My most played game is CS GO of course. Rank LEM 9.5 RWS on ESEA. Not that it matters.   I usually browse the subreddit multiple times per day and I am able to access it nearly any time of the day.   I'm a little shy at first but once I get to know people Im genuinely really sarcastic in a joking way and nice to everyone. 	13-18 months	I like the community. It is varied and for the most part VERY mature. 
5/30/2015 23:38:55	http://reddit.com/u/vikinick	GMT-7	20	I am experienced with regex (Unix and IRC experience) and have basic experience with HTML but not CSS or JavaScript. I have completed classes on Java and C++ and am taking classes on SQL. I am attempting to teach myself CSS, JavaScript and Python.		They are pretty fun (I've only done one however). It seems to be fairly well run and I wish I could participate in more.	I haven't really popped into those threads much.	I am on reddit from around 19:00 GMT to 09:00 GMT and can watch and pay attention to the subreddit during those times.  I currently mod a few subreddits (/r/Gonzaga - tiny, /r/crushingstuff - basically dead, and /r/vikinick - where I essentially just screw around with the mod tools).  I am currently a computer science major at Gonzaga.  	4-6 months	The community are a bit too critical on valve in general. Maintaining a game of this caliber is pretty difficult, and made harder because the community is scrutinizing every decision they make.  That being said, I really love this subreddit. The mods seem to be active enough to be seen but not overbearing enough that I know them by name. It seems to be a very good balance.
5/30/2015 23:39:41	https://reddit.com/u/awesomedeer	UTC-4	21	While I do not have an expert insight I have taught myself random amounts of coding when I need it. I understand the basics of most and can self teach myself what I need to know. 	Yes I've moderated CSS servers(bhop, surf, jailbreak, dm) and I am currently running my own surf server.	I believe it's an excellent way to bring the community together.  The community and staff hosting this event shows that you want to be part of the system and further increase CSGOs alreay growing reputation.	Also an excellent way to bring the community together and it really encourages the new players to be more involved.	I live in North Carolina and currently enlisted in the Marines.  I have been an active Counter-strike member since 1.6 and hope to continue that for as long as possible.    I have moderated numerous Counter-strike server and currently running my own server. I also have  had a good reputation as a whole.   I believe the community would be an even better place if I was allowed to moderate.   I am not famous with the community in the least but hope to change that.  	19-24 months	The community is at the highest it's ever been and that goes to show the moderators and administrators are doing a fine job.  I have not had a problem with any of the moderators and the team does a good job of weeding out the bad apples.
5/30/2015 23:51:40	http://reddit.com/u/ieyepawd	UTC-5	17	Yes, I've been programming for 3 years. I'm experienced with NodeJS (Also JavaScript, basically the same), C#, HTML and (not the best designer but) CSS. 	I don't know if this counts but I've made random servers whenever I needed them to play with friends on a Linux box I had left over from my other projects. I know rcon commands and how to setup a server from scratch, I've played around with it a bit. 	I wish it wasn't too late because I tend to get way too tired for CSGO at night. 	I've asked a question on Newbie Thursday when I was a lower rank. I liked how everyone was friendly and willing to help out. 	Hello, my name is Danny and I'm a 17 year old highschool student living in Canada.   I started playing CS back in 2010 (?) it was either 1.6 or Source. Me and my cousin torrented it and 5v5'd with bots. After a couple years, I got a steam account and picked up CSGO. One of my first FPS games, however I didn't get into it until 2014. I've also played a couple Battlefield titles and I've been active on their subreddits as well.   I tend to lurk a lot on Reddit but I recently (Late 2014) made a Reddit account to help out whenever I can. I would like to contribute to the community and I enjoy all the work other Redditor contributed to this subreddit.   Like mentioned above, I enjoy programming and it has taught me a lot. I started programming in 2012 because a friend of mine thought it was cool.   Thanks for cosidering! 	4-6 months	I think the /r/GlobalOffensive community is a very friendly place for anyone to ask questions like I've mentioned above. Even some moderators are willing to help out the players trying to improve (voo). 
5/30/2015 23:52:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/MemeDreamZ/	GMT-4	18	I have taken a year of AP Computer Science in high school which taught Java basics and I am majoring in Computer Science in college.	I've admined a few very small CSGO servers for friends. Mostly jailbreak or mini-games that are no longer around. But I used to admin some Garry's Mod and Minecraft servers for about 3 years.   If this question is about admin experience in general, I have admined a ton of Facebook group, pages and even some website forums. If you want a detailed list on my history with all that just message me on Reddit or something.	I've participated 3 times and I really feel like they could be organized much better. Maybe with a Google Form or even a web-page to host all the information and links. 	Extremely helpful. I used to browse through them a lot when I was a silver/nova and they really helped me out a lot. I don't read them much anymore though.	As previously stated, I'm just a typical 18 year old guy from Columbus Ohio whose majoring in Comp Sci. I quite literally eat, sleep and breath Counter Strike. CSGO was really the first CS I played seriously. I played Source for a few months, but really only Jailbreak and Minigame servers. All my free time at home is devoted to CS. When I'm not playing, I'm either browsing the sub or watching streams. I've dragged multiple friends into playing and they're really starting to enjoy it too.   I really pride myself on always improving my game and staying informed on current events and I rely on the sub to do that. I would really love to be able to give back to the community and I think I could help out a lot on the admin team.   Also, if it means anything, since I do live in Columbus I am 2 miles away from the CEVO LAN center and could do anything such as photography or live updates  or behind the scenes stuff there.   Anyways, thanks for giving me this opportunity to apply for this position. If chosen I'll do my best to improve the sub to the best of my ability. 	13-18 months	Honestly, I really admire how the subreddit is run in the sense that (aside from threads asking for new admins) you never really even see the admins. Which may not sound like a good thing, but on other sub-reddits at least, the admins tend to create a lot of drama and tear a lot of the community apart and I've never once seen that in this sub. The admins here just clean up everything behind the scenes and I really think that works out great for this type of community.
5/31/2015 0:16:28	https://www.reddit.com/user/EzPzLmnSqzy/	GMT-4	18	Nope	Nope	I think it's great, and I think promoting (and even having) a subreddit mumble server, and encouraging players to use it and to play with other members of the community is really healthy and contributes/ will contribute a lot to the growth of the subreddit. I think that community night can be a great opportunity for people to make friends to play CSGO with (or just to be friends with) and there are definitely some lonely people that come to Reddit, and Community Night could be the only chance they get to play games with friends. Community Night is definitely a great idea and I can see it helping individuals grow as well as the community as a whole, although I do recommend putting in the sticky description of it that it's just for fun, to try and discourage potential raging(?) I don't know if that's even a problem it's just something that occurred to me as a possibility	I'm a huge League of Legends junkie and I frequent /r/LoL, and they have a Monday Megathread which is the same thing, and I love the idea of it, and I think it's great. CSGO is pretty much constantly changing, so new questions will constantly be popping up from new players and old players alike. Also with eSports growing this fast there will be lots of new players constantly, and having/seeing this thread is a great way to open the subreddit's figurative arms to newcomers and welcome them to the community in a way they feel comfortable, instead of having to jump straight into all the threads where everyone already knows everything.	I am 18 years old, I was born on April 15th, 1997, my last day of school was May 22nd, but I don't graduate until June 7th, I will be working at a self-serve frozen yogurt shop this summer (same as last) and I will be attending North Park University in the fall. It's a small college in northern Chicago so my timezone will be changing by 1 hour in September. I plan on majoring in history and minoring in secondary education as I (as of right now) want to teach history at a high school level.   I've never had a gaming system (Wii doesn't count right?) so I've been a PC gamer for as long as I can remember, starting with RuneScape and Miniclips before moving onto League of Legends (too much time and money spent) and Counter Strike GO (too much time to still be GN2) with other games sprinkled in here and there, but LoL and CSGO are the only games I play regularly. Recently I started doing Overwatch and I enjoy that too. I will be spending the summer with my mom (parents divorced I went to high school with my dad) and I have no friends here so I will just have copious amounts of free time when I'm not working and I spend way too much time on Alien Blue and reddit in general.   I do have some experience in leadership roles, I spent a few summers doing Leader In Training (or Counselor in Training) programs at a few camps, but ultimately decided I wanted a better paying summer job so I could build a gaming PC. I have 3 younger siblings and babysit the 11&9 year old ones fairly often and I have for a while.  Besides the internet and gaming in general, I like reading, and have an interest in history, mainly the history of wars, and I like reading about people, interesting people, and their backgrounds, and I like cool facts that I can memorize easily and then bring up in conversation and make people look at me weird.  I think I covered all relevant parts of my life without boring you to death, but if there's anything else at all you guys would like to know don't be afraid to PM me (EzPzLmnSqzy on reddit) I'd love to help!  Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and I hope to hear from you guys soon.	0-3 months	I think the community is good, for how large it is. When there are over 200k subs, there are obviously some bad eggs in the bunch but overall I haven't seen any blind hate, racial slurs, or sensed any crazy or uncalled for hostility, but this could also be because the mods remove it all before I get there. It can be fairly circlejerk-esque but that's pretty much not going to change and seems to be what reddit as a whole is like, and is definitely not limited to just /r/GO.  From personal experience, people seem nice and welcoming to new comers which is something I love seeing, and getting an answer to a simple question rather than getting joke answers on a random thread was something I really appreciated.  One thing I would change is policy on tweets and workshop posts. I don't recommend disallowing them but I think both of them fall under "low effort" posts (I know you have it under the 'No screenshots' part of the rules, but I mean direct links to tweets like the post of the front page right now: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/37uwit/jw_to_stream_tonights_match_vs_envyus_from_his_pov/) and I would recommend moving both direct links to tweets like the aforementioned and workshop posts to text post only, because, to me, it seems like seeing a cool gun on the workshop and posting it and linking from twitter are both fairly low effort and are often times just people looking for easy karma.   One more current event, the PhantomL0rd thread, I think is a bad idea, scrolling through it just seems like a lot of hate for him, and even people who are (attempting to) answering the question are just guessing and still being hurtful about it, but that's just me
5/31/2015 0:03:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/Wasabicannon/	GMT-5	24	I am a novice in FileMaker database code an AutoHotKey.  Not sure how much this can help though..	Not really with admining a server however I feel like it still applies.  Back in the day when I was playing an older MMORPG there were different "armies" and one of the divisions that we (BIA) had was the admin division. Our tasks were to show new recruits around the army, how the act as a soldier and help them through the recruitment process. Outside of that we were also in charge in running event not only for the army but for the whole Buyan city to try and gain new members and give back to the city.  I was ~12 back then but it gave me a great introduction to following processes and documenting information for others to view.			While I may not be to into watching the competitive side of CSGo I do enjoy playing the competitive side of CSGo both official MM and 3rd party MM.  I work in a call center so when things are slow at work I tend to spend A LOT of time on reddit.  I fully understand if I don't get picked for this however I always like to submit these just to see what happens. :)  Thank you for reading over my application.  1 horse sized duck	19-24 months	Overall I think the current path of /r/GlobalOffensive is great.  It does not feel like it will happen but I am always worried that as CSGo gets more popular /r/GlobalOffensive will begin to become a subreddit more like /r/LeagueofLegends  I will be honest, I was scared with when I saw PhantomL0rd streaming CSGo. I thought the subreddit was going to have a shitstorm but the subreddit is better then I though or the current mods were on point with clearing out the crap.
5/31/2015 0:06:56	http://reddit.com/u/LATlN	GMT-5	14	not much but I can understand some Lua stuff lol	nope	none really	none really [2]	only been playing counter strike for a few months, around 9  I dunno im 14 and the second smartest person in my grade in my school, taking college classes and stuff, I've lost a lot of CSGO skins to a keylogger and im really nice and would love to help make people happy and stop scams and hacks  don't really expect to become a mod, but if I did People would like me (except that im young)  Csgo is an obsession for me, I'm only nova 2 but this game is so fun and I'd love to take it up a notch and participate on the next level   oh yeah, and I love cat puns  thanks and glhf	0-3 months	they're good people but im not sure if they can all be trusted
5/31/2015 0:17:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/321System123	GMT+0	19	I have certifications that basically say that I am very knowledgeable with HTML + CSS + JS which means I can make a website look and feel pretty. I have a fundamental understanding of Python and PHP, I'm currently running a Linux box on my laptop in which I have been making Python and Bash scripts.  Alongside my Website design experience I have been working on PHP for the last few years in my college course. Once you get the tags and expressions it is actually a fun language to play with.  Truthfully the only experience I have with NodeJS is with HTML5 canvas which I helped develop agar.io partially. 	Last year I was short on cash and decided to rent out a few dedicated servers from OVH. I partitioned the drives and installed a solusvm to allow things to be more stable when I created a bunch of small VPS clusters within the server.  With these VPS clusters I would either resell or install GameServers on there, I believe I installed OpenGamePanel to administrate all the servers at once and installed CSGO on each of them. I then sold a few and had the rest for my community.  Unfortunately I am not good with money and forgot to make a profit out of it, the dream died shortly after.  While I had a the servers a few communities wanted me to manage them and install various plugins .e.g E-Bot, Sourcemod (engine and plugins)	I once got drunk and decided to try it out, it wasn't untill I joined the game in which I found out it was a US Community Night, Needless to say people were not pleased.	I think helping new players is needed for a community to have a strong growth, the CS series has a large learning curve and any help will be beneficial to people.   That being said....  "No, CS doesn't have iron sights, except for the SG 553"	I am a 19 year old programming student currently awaiting my time to go to university, I am currently finishing my college course.  In my spare time I like to chill out and play a bit of CS (which I imagine you could read between the lines) and watch streams. I like to think of myself as a nice person, I don't argue with people, I am obedient, although sometimes my British side comes out and I may goof about on Teamspeak or ingames.  I also like to code websites, I currently got a side job doing web design and website development which I find fulfilling but I always like to have a challenge.  CSGO has been a escape for me, coming home after a long day and playing the game has been a way for me to chill, I just want to give back to the community.	19-24 months	Predictable, very, very, predictable, but sometimes lovable.   Sometimes the community acts like a dictatorship and demands certain things, they are like a pack of hungry wolves who need feeding, but if you mess up they will eat you.  But also sometimes they are cool. Just don't mess up.
5/31/2015 0:20:44	http://www.reddit.com/user/rameshliyanage	GMT+5	25	Yes, I have extensive experience in coding in HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, etc. I currently am working with Python, Node, Mongo, Angular, etc as well. I am the lead developer of GLD Studios (gldstudios.lk), a startup I began a couple of months back. 	I have experience in setting up servers from the days of Counter Strike 1.6. We used to host our own game servers in the country and rented it out to clans and players as well through a company we setup called GameLadders (gameladders.lk). At our peak we ran nearly 45-50 Counter Strike 1.6 servers. Further, we started our own gaming community here called Gamer.LK (gamer.lk) which we continue to operate. Eventhough we discontinued renting out servers a few years back, our community servers on Gamer.LK continue to exist. We are currently upgrading our dedicated server hosted in Singapore and as such for the next few weeks will be rebuilding and rehosting it completely. My experience in building servers on Linux is extensive and usually deploy servers from scratch. Our current teamspeak servers are run from Singapore on a VPS setup on DigitalOcean. I have in the past corresponded directly with Alfred Reynolds, etc from Valve on server and Valve related updates as well and continue to be a subscriber on the mailing lists as well.	I have seen it around and would love to join, however since I am from SEA the server ping to EU or NA is very high. I believe its a very good and worthwhile initiative. We used to have the same "Community Night" based concept in SL for CS 1.6 back then to popularise the game and it caught on quite a lot. It also helped us build a very active CS community here. 	I believe its a great and really helpful thing. I have been lurking around it and I feel that some of the members who post in it are really helping the community quite a lot. I believe it should continue and any improvements if any that the community wants should be given since that is one of the main ways newbies will initiate themselves to the game. That is also probably one of the main places new redditors might join the /r/GlobalOffensive community so it is good to leave a good impression.	Well, I am from Sri Lanka and I currently I spend the majority of my time working on my own startup and spend the rest of the time gaming and with my family. I am one of the administrators and lead developer of Gamer.LK (http://gamer.lk/), Sri Lanka's Gaming Community. I handle all the development aspects of the site. Each year we hold numerous tournaments, from CS:GO, COD, DOTA2, LOL, etc and these are held at national level and at huge public venue. I am an active part of these tournament organizing committees and oversee and handle all the networking and server deployments at such venues/tournaments. I also have my own gaming clan which I run with a few friends (http://www.xiphosesports.com) and we have been in existence for the longest in SL. Our forum is at http://forum.xiphosesports.com/index.php. Besides that I play the guitar, love spending time with my friends, family and loved ones. I love to self study and come up with solutions on my own and love to challenge myself each day. Even signing up for this was a challenge of sorts since I dont think I can be even considered but i believe I can be of service to the subreddit and to the other mods and that I will be a worthwhile part of the team. 	10-12 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is very good and I have been lurking and observing things here for quite sometime. I believe the content has improved a lot and there are much more worthwhile posts coming up. I really love how patch notes get compiled and then discussed very quickly and extensively here. It is heartening to see how much the subreddit has grown and there are so many players coming into CSGO as well. I have noticed a few trolls around myself but it exists in every community and as the community grows this can only be expected. But the good and useful outweigh such minor things and it is important to maintain this balance and keep the subreddit moving forward.
5/31/2015 0:45:18	https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Smogz/	GMT+10	16	HTML - I understand and know the basics of HTML when it comes to creating basic web pages and layouts. I am currently working on learning CSS, as I can then apply my HTML knowledge to it and create stylish web pages. Hopefully then I'll be able to create new styles for subreddits!	I do indeed have experience with administration and moderating, on several different communities, it all ranges from a lot of games and forums.  One of the biggest experiences I have had with administration / moderating would be GTA: San Andreas Multiplayer (or SA-MP for short). There was a server I joined called 'Hot Blooded Gaming'. After about 2 months of playing and browsing their forums, I decided I would apply for a staff position. I was fortunately accepted, and stayed for roughly 10 months before the server manager shut the actual server down. Throughout those 10 months, I learnt a lot in terms on how to administrate and deal with players from all around the world. I would probably say communication and patience were the two biggest qualities that I learnt were so important. Not only did I seek out rule breakers in the actual game (constant text chat as it was a role play server), but I moderated the forums for them too. I handled most of the public relations in terms of posts to the community itself, and that was a good experience for me. Note: The original owner of Hot Blooded Gaming sold the server to someone else. That owner renamed the community to 'Intergaming'.  I feel as if that 10 month period of administrating a 300 player community was a great experience for me, and taught me quite a bit, that I feel has made me a better person in general. Yes, a 300 player community is nothing compared to the CS:GO Reddit you guys have here, but I certainly know that I can apply those skills and experience here.	I love how you don't need to be good at the game and have a high skill level to be able to participate in it, as this gives every single individual a chance to have a go, and have some fun while doing so!  It gives everyone in the community a chance to meet new people, and maybe even make some close friends to play competitively with. I'm all for making new friends online, and this is a great way to go about doing so. It's awesome that you guys provide the servers for everyone to use and communicate through, as there's always a better experience when you're speaking with someone through microphone then text chatting.  Hey, maybe one day I'll be able to organize an Oceania community night. This will solve the need for players in Australasia to wake up really early / late just to attend a community night.	I play League of Legends, and there's something similar to this on their subreddit. It's a great idea to improve, not only new player's knowledge, but even experienced players, as not everyone knows everything. Everyone knows their own little bit, and this is a great way for people to learn and improve their knowledge about Global Offensive, or Counter-Strike in general.  Basically what I'm trying to get at is it's like putting a puzzle together, everyone fills in their own little piece, that piece being knowledge. That knowledge can then be used in many different ways, and can be stretched out and flexed out for many different interpretations among everyone. It's great to have a reliable source and environment for people to agree and disagree on points / ideas.	Well to get started, my name is Justin, I'm 16 and was born in South Africa. Both my parents decided to move to Australia in 2007 after several different riots and the crime that was taking place frequently. They did it for my brother's, and my future. I can tell you now that they definitely made the right decision about migrating over to Australia. I settled in Australia quickly, making friends and learning about the culture.  I would like to call myself a mature person for my age as many have said to me. I have a good sense of humor which I am always using with my peers around me whether it be online or offline. My joy is making other people joyful... that's what I like to do. But please, don't get me wrong, I know where the line is and I never cross it because there's a difference between having a joke and taking it overboard. I'm trustworthy, kind and honest. I've never had a problem helping people, I actually enjoy doing it. I'm a patient person, too. This is obviously extremely needed when you are working with people from all around the world.  I would consider myself a strong leader that enjoys helping and making a difference. I know this is a cliché, but I know I will make a difference around the community. Not everyone is a leader, and I'm lucky to have that kind of skill set. Leading is about teaching, communicating and advising towards a safer and happier future, showing people the positive way. I'm able to do that. Whenever I am able to make a positive outcome on someone or something, I'm happy! :)  I am completely fluent in writing, reading and speaking English. English would probably have to be my favorite subject in school. I'm not sure why, but I just enjoy doing it and do quite well in it, mostly above average for where I am currently sitting. Reddit is a great way for me to express myself over the internet on subjects I like such as gaming. I enjoy writing stories, and as I stated above I did most of the public relations for a community I used to be a part of. While we're on the subject of school, I love it and I'm doing really well. I manage a fine balance between doing my school work and gaming, and that balance is working quite well for me.  I would like to elaborate about my working ethics, as I believe they play a big role in a position like this. I'm organized, have great work habits and I hold good social skills. A good moderator needs to be organized as you hold a lot of power over others, and have the responsibility of helping and managing. Being organized is extremely important when you're generally organizing and moderating a large subreddit like this. I have positive work habits and ethics. Diligence is one of my work habits that I use constantly and basically sums up everything about me. I'm constantly improving the quality of my work and taking in constructive criticism. I'm adaptable which means I can complete and work on different tasks at once, which is extremely important as moderators are constantly being contacted and required. You need to be adaptable to manage and get things done quickly. Initiative is another big factor you need to have and take into consideration while being a moderator, and it's exactly what I hold. Taking initiative on the subreddit to supervise others, managing and teaching. My productivity is always at a high standard meaning I'm always giving out quality work. Finally, my social and communication skills are above par. Every good moderator needs to be able to communicate with their peers through messages in a fluent manner. I hold exactly that. If you aren't clear or fluent while communicating, instructions and important questions will not be followed or answered meaning there's a lack of efficiency. I believe that all of the skills I have listed above are of qualities which I hold.  EDIT: I'm currently quite a lurker throughout the subreddit, but I will definitely make an edit and begin to participate in discussions!	0-3 months	To be quite frank with you, I'm quite the lurker of the community and Reddit. I mostly take a look at the new threads being submitted because most of the time I have seen and read the front page threads that have attracted a lot of attention. Those asking for help usually receive it without being flamed for being new to the game or not knowing x and y. Those that do flame and represent the community badly in /r/GlobalOffensive are swiftly dealt with by the moderators or the general population of the community that you have set up here with down votes.  /r/GlobalOffensive is a nice place for several different reasons, and those reasons are that you can express your opinions in a non-hostile manner, and not be banned for it. It's a nice place for new players to the game (and experienced) to ask questions about x and y, and to learn about the fantastic game that this is. I originally joined the /r/GlobalOffensive reddit community just because I wanted to read up and learn more about certain strategies and tips from the community. I found several organized threads, including Newbie Thursdays, where I could review what others have said about the game. I was then able to apply this knowledge in game, which has been extremely helpful to me. The discussions and points that are brought up by the many players of the game on this Reddit are always ranging. They range from the competitive scene to game mechanics, so forth. It's a great place for passionate players to gather together to give their opinions and participate in discussions.  To sum up this question, it's a well organized subreddit that is a nice place for the passionate gamers of Global Offensive to all join up and discuss and give their own opinions about the topic at hand, in a managed, clean environment for all to enjoy.

Sounds fun for people into that sort of thing.	IDK what that is.	I'm an Logistics & IT Manager at a small but renown recruiting agency by trade. I serve drinks to NC State students some nights some weekends (legally). I've played CS since 5.2 beta, it was my brothers copy. I played 1.6 competitively and have been in the same position in the scene for about 15 years. I play with a lot of professional players, I'm always a 6th due to lack of time dedication. More recently I have been a behind the scenes man for a lot of my friends and organizations. I helped startup Lunatik in the CSGO scene, I assisted denial into acquiring their first team. And I negotiated the Liquid contracts for the players originally. Among plenty of connections I made for players with organizations and vice versa. I now play CSGO for fun and just started streaming as a hobby. I always said if an offer came along where I can still work my 9-5 and play competitively I would. My name is Chris. I'm running out of things to type. "Wordy"     Oh as far as communities go. In terms of skill level.  (in NA) ESEA > MM > CEVO > FACEIT  No I will not play esea until they provide me with reputable vuln tests to prove my computer is safe with them.	13-18 months	I think it has the loudest voice that the csgo devs listen to the most. And it often times yells in the wrong direction or the wrong things due to lack of knowledge or experience. Which causes shitty updates and changes for people who play the game competitively, not just for fun.
5/31/2015 0:26:22	http://www.reddit.com/user/platinumt	GMT-5	15	I have a bit of experience in lua coding. I don't have much but I was the weapon manager for a TTT server for about a year.	As stated above, I was a part of a TTT Gmod server, where I was a Co-Owner for a good year.	I've only participated in one, and while it was fun, it did seem like many people were there just to annoy. Was fun though.	It seems good, but I haven't ever participated in one.	At the moment, I am an NA FACEIT Admin. I am 15 years old and I'm about to finish my sophomore year of high school. I am in my school marching band, so that may conflict a bit. I would really like to be more part of the CS community, and what better place to get moving along then here :-)	0-3 months	It's one of the best communities for CSGO I've ever seen. I'm not saying this to try to get this position. I came from HLTV.org and oh my god this place is heaven compared to them.
5/31/2015 0:27:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/TeZzA900/	GMT+10	22	Little to none.	I have been in control of many servers during my time, from games like Soldat (Old school 2D shooter) to Call of Duty to Rust along with many others. A long with that I was a platform administrator on Cybergamer Xbox and ran Call Of Duty for ACL for around 12 months (www.aclpro.com.au). 	I was going to read up on this as it is something that I openly do not know much about. I along with a lot of others use /r/globaloffensive as a base for which to launch any csgo queries or stories from. I do read other sites for information about csgo but most of which are linked off of the sub.	Again same thing, I do not really know much about this.	My name is Terence I am 22 years old currently undertaking a Bachelor of Education, I live in Australia and am an avid gamer and computer user. Typically speaking if I am not asleep I have some form of technology close by. I have worked in many customer service based jobs in my life which would help with this position. I may not have the biggest reddit profile as I along with so many others enjoy the lurk. I honestly don't expect to get this role because of that fact, but what would I be to this community if I didn't at least offer to help?   I do think that this is well within my range of works, having to deal with spoiled gamers in the flesh and make on the spot tournament decisions when I was with ACL will surely make this easier.  Eitherway have a good day Terence	10-12 months	The csgo community overtime has seemingly been sharpening their pitchforks and just waiting to be critical to anyone or about anything, I personally like the community, for the most part you will always have some sour apples out there and when there is 220k+ subs there will be a lot of them. I think that the light shines through though and a lot of the content is good and a large chunk of the commenters are fine. When a big story breaks obviously (e.g matchfixing) holy hell does the community turn bad.
5/31/2015 0:27:47	http://www.reddit.com/u/ob4d4h	GMT-6	19	C++, HTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Ajax.	Been admin an admin for a gaming community for about 7 months now. (CS:GO servers mainly)			I love computers, I am a computer science student. Just finished my second year. I'm applying because I feel like I have enough skills but I'm not sure if I might have to go on a vacation in the summer. Thought I'd apply either way and I'll make sure after.	10-12 months	I really like it. It's the only reasonable place to discuss CS:GO. Over the time I feel like the people are just getting more and more pissed at Valve and this is causing the comment section to become a big circlejerk, but you know, it's reddit after all.
5/31/2015 0:27:52	https://www.reddit.com/user/Thompsonhunt/	GMT-7	26	Only very basic coding with HTML and Javascript	I do not. 	For building communities, Reddit has much to contribute and the potential benefits from community driven days is a real great step. I've yet to have the specific time to invest in playing during the event but I'm sure I have an idea at the level of fun it offers. 	I didn't even know that existed but as mentioned before I'm all for community driven events. 	I'm constantly working and when I have free time I'm either on the sub Reddit or playing CS. I'm more or less reserved when it comes to expressing myself digitally, and tend to attempt to keep myself open to new ideas and experiences. 	7-9 months	Thats a difficult question to answer since it is comprised of a gradient of different individuals all coming from different angles. Overall I find that the sub Reddit is up to date on CSGO events and matches. There are fair amount of interesting AMAs and I always have something to click on. I rarely am disgruntled by anything 
5/31/2015 0:34:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/__SPooKY/	GMT-6	24	I am a Front-end Architect by day and with that, have extensive experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, various preprocessors (LESS, SASS, etc.), Grunt/Gulp, and many more. Along with that, I have limited experience with PHP, Java, and Python and various frameworks (CakePHP, Laravel, Spring, Django).	I am the Team Owner for Caffeinated and with that, I manage all of our servers. I'm also working with Kubz as a sponsor for the Unofficial Reddit Cup to provide servers. With my experience, I have:  - Vanilla CS:GO Servers - MetaMod/SourceMod Servers - WarMod PUG Servers - Deathmatch Servers - 1v1 Servers - Practice Servers  I have experience using hosted solutions like Gameservers and NFO, but most of my experience is running instances on VPS systems from Linode, Vultr, Google Compute with dedicated virtual resources.	I have not had the opportunity to participate in one, however I think that they offer exciting opportunities to meet new players and test up-and-coming maps.	Newbie Thursday allows players (new or not) to ask questions in an organized manner and receive honest, clear opinions. Many threads which aren't actively moderated don't get the attention they deserve or get derailed. The Newbie Thursday thread helps reduce this.	I am a 24-year-old living in Denver, Colorado with my wife and son. Our entire family plays Counter-Strike and I've been playing since shortly before 1.6.  I'm fortunate enough to work from home full-time as a programmer, which results in lots of time surfing the web and playing games. I enjoy being informed and helpful regardless of the situation. While I tend to be more antisocial, when gaming is involved (especially Counter-Strike) I come out of my shell.  Every couple of weeks, I host Counter-Strike PUGs at a local LAN center (Clutch Gaming Arena, the hosts of ClutchCon). I've become a fairly popular individual within the Colorado Counter-Strike community.  I'm hoping to become a moderator of /r/GlobalOffensive because I have received so much valuable information, fun content, and news that I would like to give back to the community.	10-12 months	With only about a year of lurking and posting, I have experienced a decent amount of growth over a number of majors. The growing pains have been mostly around floods of duplicate threads in 'new' from what I've seen.  I think my biggest criticism would be the increasing number of "I have ranked up!" threads where players feel as though now that they have reached [insert rank here] they should either receive praise or deserve an AMA-style thread. Sometimes, these bubble up to the first two pages but don't provide much value and often times result in misinformation or toxic comments.  Otherwise, I feel as though the majority of the content in the subreddit is valuable, informative, or interesting in one way or another. It is my go-to place for patch information and news about the professional scene especially.
5/31/2015 0:49:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/Duscnov/	UTC+10	16		I have experience in admining servers. They were hosted by Pantheon  (link : http://pantheones.com.au/). It was predominately a surf server with a variety of fun mini-games. The communities on the server ranged from young (12) to more older (40), the average age being 15-20. The server itself was very lively and under control, thanks to the team of admins. 	My only thoughts on community nights are when will they come to AU. I am always feeling left out as EU and NA have all the fun, but yes i do come to terms with the majority of the player base from EU and Na.	My thoughts on Newbie Thursday is really how beautiful this community is, in other games e.g Dota, LoL hatred is spread among the 'lesser skilled' players. Me being Master Guardian (i wouldn't consider it to be that bad) i find Newbie Thursday to be quite informative. 	Myself as a person; I tend to talk excessively, i am good at arguing a point  (i have essays to prove it!), I generally love communicating with others. I do sporting activities; Cricket and Tennis (i play cricket for a club and tennis is just a regular activity with my friends), I also focus on my studies and play games (majority of the time csgo).   PS: Thank you for reading this, i know you've wasted several hours reading these applications just to improve the community, thank you again.	7-9 months	I personally believe the community has grown tremendously over these past months, and yes it has brought along more 'trolls' the mods have done specifically well e.g deleted (ironic really) nearly every thread i view i see his comment being deleted (even on newly listed posts).
5/31/2015 0:50:49	http://reddit.com/user/Backlong/	UTC-7	21	None.	No.	Community Nights are great! They provide a great way for the community to get together and play. (I'm especially fond of the more casual ones.)	Newbie Thursday is also nice, and I am in no way saying it should go, but it feels unnecessary. Google exists for a reason, and while Newbie Thursday provides information maybe more personally, Google could probably help just as much.	Well, I guess I could start with my experience.  I moderate three subs worthy of notice: ledootgeneration (a funposting sub with almost 18k subscribers) WebGames (around 87k subscribers, exactly what it sounds like) and TownofSalemGame (the sub for an indie webgame with almost 4k subscribers.) It's not much, but it's what I got.  Me.  I am twenty one years old and currently in college majoring in Economics (yes, it's boring :(). I love animals and of course video games. One of my favorite animals is the macaw. If you'd like to know more about macaws I could go on forever, but I'm sure that's not appropriate here ;). I love reading, as well. I had a 4.0 GPA all the way up until highschool. Now, I usually average around 3.6. I'm very social, but I'm an introvert, if that makes any sense. I love to talk to people, but after a while it just drains the life out of me.  I feel very underqualified, but thanks for reading anyways. I'd love to join you guys.	0-3 months	I haven't really been active for a long time, or really ever, mostly I just lurk. Okay, so I always just lurk ;). The community is usually friendly, but, as reddit is, of one opinion. You don't often see different opinions on the same topic. Not that they don't exist, they're just rare.
5/31/2015 0:56:39	http://reddit.com/user/zzyxxy	GMT+10	23	I haven't coded in HTML or CSS since high school so it's safe to say I have no experience at all. 	I used to run a surf server through multiplay, which involved the use of cpanel and ftp to set up. I was running metamod, sourcemod and various plugins on the server. The server was mainly for my friends and I to play, it didn't gain much traction so I stopped hiring it. 	I'd love to join, however due to living in Australia I would probably not have a good time. 	With a game having an increasing amount of players I think that Newbie Thursday is a great idea. 	When I'm not at work, I like to spend most of my time at my PC with one of my four cockatiels on my shoulder. I don't know if I have a much of a chance, however, I thank you for taking the time to read this application. 	2-3 years	I am mostly a lurker on reddit and especially /r/globaloffensive. I've been following the sub since CSGO was in beta, and it's amazing to see the numbers grow, especially in the last couple of years. I have not seen any malicious intent from the moderators in regards to this subreddit. 
5/31/2015 1:00:01	https://www.reddit.com/user/taculaR187/	GMT+10	20	No.	I have experience with admining servers on multiple source games, Such as:  - Garry's Mod - Counter Strike: Source - CS:GO  Garry's Mod i used to be an administrator for TPS Gaming for many years until the servers shut down.  For CS:S I used to be a temp admin for a Jailbreak server, and last but not least:  CS:GO, Administrator for a Jailbreak server.	I find it a good idea, However there's no chance for us Australians to play  :(.	It's a fantastic idea for new players to ask questions and get answers by more experienced players, I myself have used this opportunity to ask a question about spray management, in which was quickly answered by the helpful community members.	Well, I'm just a gamer from down under passionate about CS:GO, I play in the Australian CyberGamer League and I frequently browse ''le reddit'. I have a brother who also shares my reddit account and we both enjoy this sub-reddit, along with /r/PcMasterRace & /r/tifu (hehe).  Nonetheless, I hope you all have a great day/night where ever you are.  o/ volvo plz	7-9 months	It's an alright sub-reddit with very intelligent individuals, However there seems to be a-lot of whining on this sub-reddit(as with any game subreddit in my opinion) But generally, I frequent it everyday to see the latest updates, insane clips and just funny videos.
5/31/2015 1:02:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/SirSquaggle/	GMT+0	19	No, however I'm toatally open to learn!	I have admined on a few minecraft servers and a BF3 server a couple of years ago but nothing serious.	I haven't really taken part yet, partly due to a poor experience partaking in something similar on League of Legends, though I would like to join in some time.	I really like it, I enjoy reading through the questions and answers. Most weeks I find something new about the game that I never knew even with 1300+hrs on my main. It's a really awesome thread and my favourite weekly.	I have been a moderator on a website called gamereplays.org for a long time, about 2.5 years. I've had a lot of experience with dealing with certain issues and trolls etc. Now I'm kind of looking for somewhere new to mod and help out as I no longer play the game I used to be section mod for (C&C Generals: Zero Hour) and the community activity there has also dropped dramatically. If you are interested, here is a link to my profile there: http://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?s=5deaa853532ce70c87fa953218c7d19d&showuser=147761  I have always enjoyed spending time browsing community topics on the games I love to play and have a lot of admiration and respect for the people who run and maintain the forums, boards or whatever to keep them a nice positive experience for the users browsing and posting. Due to this admiration and respect I have always wanted to offer some of my time to help out and give a little bit back. Sadly I'm not artistic, insanely good at the game or rich so the best I can do is offer my time and utilise my people skills to contribute!  Thanks so much for reading this, I sincerly appreciate the time it takes you guys to do the work you do and go through all of these applications!  Richard (Squaggle).	4-6 months	I enojoy the current CSGO reddit community, I kind of like the fact it's not as big as the League of Legends community as browsing the new section isn't so full of trashy spam threads, maybe that's because the mods here keep on top of it more. The majority of people I've encountered are pleasant and from my long time reading/lurking I've really not seen many nasty people.   People posting are normally very original and creative which makes it my favourite sub to read.
5/31/2015 1:08:38	http://www.reddit.com/user/voodoufreak	GMT-4	17	I have a little experience with JavaScript.		I think they are great and a really fun way to learn about the game. I've learned alot from the Community Night. Various people would help me out and explain certain strats or things I'm doing wrong. I try to come out to the community night as much as I can but sometimes i can't due to the hours. 	I don't have many due to the fact that I've never actually explored it.	I have been lurking for awhile but lately I've been becoming more active. I've always been a shy person and I feel as if this is a big step. I've always wanted to be active in a gaming community and always have the desire to help people out. Playing competitive video games has always been a dream for me and Counter-Strike is my favourite game and also the most comfortable game so far. I might not make it to the big leagues but at least I might get the chance to moderate a community.	10-12 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive is pretty good except there are some people I've come across which arn't the best of people. I've seen noobs get hated on for asking easy questions and i think that this subreddit shouldn't have to be limited to noobs only asking on Thursdays.
5/31/2015 1:09:44	http://reddit.com/u/AncientThrowback	GMT+8	19	Nope, sorry! Although I wish I knew. Willing to learn. :)	Unfortunately no!	Nice for community cohesion, but being from Asia I can't really enjoy much of it :/	Great to share knowledge with newbies. I wish I had less work on Thursdays, though. Would love to contribute to it. :)	Well. Here goes, then.  I'm Alyssa, I'm part of the CSGO Match Threads team. You guys, of all people, should know how annoying I might have been at the start with the modmail. (sorry! ><)  I'm a 19 year old girl from Southeast Asia, and I've been playing CS since the 1.6 era. I guess you could call me an OG girl gamer? I'm currently LEM in MM right now, although I'd really not want to give out my steam profile to anyone at all. I only play with RL friends, sorry!  Other than gaming, I'm currently pursuing a private pilot's license, and I'm even considering signing on to my country's Air Force as a pilot. I love flying too much to ever consider walking away from it.  Of the games I play, though, I mostly enjoy playing CSGO (obviously) and League. I'm a filthy plat in League, though, so I'm unfortunately no big deal.   I currently speak two languages fluently, English and Mandarin. I'm trying to learn Japanese, though, so yeah!  I'm also a casual writer, and I plan to contribute to /r/WritingPrompts when I can.  I love to contribute to discussions. I really appreciate when personal inputs are politely and properly brought up for discussion, and not devolve into a shitfest.  I hate to be narcissistic but I would think of myself as being a rather approachable person to talk to, and one of the people who are full of ideas and can enthusiastically bring them up for consideration.  As an example, the CSGO matchday/overview threads, and quite a lot of its current template, were spawned from my ideas. My own participation in making the CSGO match threads has diminished recently due to my own schedule and my own timezone differences. (Some games end up taking place past midnight here, and I really can't help with that!)  Nevertheless, it is my passion to help wherever I can. 	0-3 months	It's a hilariously wonderful mix of shitposts and meaningful discussions. Not an overbearing killjoy like on /r/leagueoflegends. I find that the /r/GO sub hiveminds much less than /r/LoL, and I generally prefer to hang around here instead of /r/LoL.  Being a part of the /r/LoL community as well I see people posting their own opinions and being shot down far too often for comfort. In /r/GO however, almost every opinion is brought up for further discussion, and to make everyone feel like their opinion counts is what I prize the most in any discussion subreddit. It is a wonderful feeling, and I wish that the subreddit can keep this up, with or even without my own contribution.  I really appreciate the way you guys handle the sub. It's setting a benchmark for other eSports subreddits, and I have absolute faith in the moderator team.
5/31/2015 1:13:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/IAmRadish/	GMT+9	24	Yes, I am a professional web applications developer. Fluent in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, SQL, C, C++ and with some experience in other languages. 	Yes, I have been a server administrator on and off for the past 10 years. My most recent position is as a technical/community administrator at http://aerolite.ovh (A gaming community which hosts source game servers). At this role I have had experience setting up and maintaining servers for CS:GO, CS:Source, TF2, Gmod and Minecraft. These servers are all hosted on rented CentOS Linux and Windows Server machines which are funded by user donations.	Unfortunately, as I am currently living in Australia for work (British by origin) I am not able to play on either the NA or EU servers due to ping. But I am fully supportive of community networking events as I have met some good friends through events like these. I would be willing to help with expanding these events to other regions if there was sufficient interest. 	Competitive "esports" games like CS:GO can have a very intimidating learning curve which may dissuade potential players from joining the community. I believe that helping new players to overcome this curve is one of the most important ways to grow and strengthen a community. 	I am a nerd, through and through. I work full time as a web applications developer and the rest of my time is spent gaming. My most played games right now are CS:GO and Dota2, I have a team of close friends that I play both with. I am genuinely interested in helping people and am always willing to drop what I am doing to lend a hand when griefers/cheaters cause problems for people on my servers. I spend a large portion of my day on Reddit with /r/globaloffensive being one of my most frequently visited. I have never been a sub mod before but I have helped out a friend of mine who designs CSS for some anime subs.  Thank you for taking the time to read my application.	4-6 months	When compared to other similar communities this sub has a very strong and welcoming user base. Of course there is a circlejerk/satirical culture as with many similar subs but I don't feel that this has gone so far as to ruin the quality of the content posted, as it has in places like /r/dota2 (I am an active player of both games but do not visit /r/dota2 much for this reason). There are genuinely insightful comments on the state of the game, tips for improving and healthy criticism of the game and its developers. Overall I find the sub to be an interesting and useful tool and it has been one of my most frequently visited subreddits. 
5/31/2015 1:33:50	http://www.reddit.com/user/xundeathlyangel/	GMT-7	16	HTML - I know how to change cursors, apply background effects like music or typical website layout, I can use html to take care of any bugs in coding such as buttons not working or glitched out images, etc.	I don't have money to own a server, and I don't admin any servers :(	I think it is a great way for any and all cs players to mingle, share, and take a break from the competitive side of cs	I think it is a good way for people to learn from each other, kinda like a group activity in a classroom. Everyone shares tips and ideas, and you take your notes and learn. When the group activity (Newbie Thursday) is over, you go to your next class for your test (MM, CEVO, ESEA, Etc.) and use your notes to help you PASS(win) your test.	I have 1000 hours in CS:GO and about 500 in source, I wasn't around for 1.6. But I love the game and all the things it offers me. From workshop maps to innovative community servers  that allow us to do things like "Co-Op" Missions. I would say what typical twitter users say: "#CSGOisLife"  I spend a lot of my free time playing games and surfing the gaming communities. If I have a big enough spark of motivation, I write short stories about encounters in my games and post them here on reddit for feedback. I love recording my gameplay and sharing it on the web and I am a frequent buyer of real-life authentic items, Like knives from CSGO or cans of food from DayZ. When I notice something out of whack or not supposed to be the way it is, I typically look for ways to better it myself, and if it's out of my hands I always report to the nearest authority to QUICKLY fix the matter. I love helping and fixing things as fast as possible because I know what it is like to need help and then have to wait 5 days for it to be looked at.	7-9 months	I think the current moderators are doing a great job. Hands down. What I would like to change in the community is the bland posts. It doesnt happen all the time, but sometimes I see imgur or gfys of things that I dont really see fit as being a post. A few weeks ago someone said they "control their spray like olof." I sat there and thought: "Okay, congrats." I know it may sound rude, but anyone who knows how to shoot an AK-47 should know how to control their spray. As for my posts, if I post anything usually I get some good and bad feedback which I can use to later make my posts better. I've met many fun players through the reddit community and I think that it is only going up from it's current state.
5/31/2015 1:27:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/mikaelmasm/	GMT-3	22	HTML and a little bit of Python	Yes, i run my team's server.	One of the best ways to make friends, have fun.	Helping younglings is a virtue.	My name is Mikael, im from Brazil, i am a very happy guy, hope you guys understand.	19-24 months	Too many trolls, but i access 20h/day so i can moderate literally everything.
5/31/2015 1:48:17	https://www.reddit.com/user/Phaethon42/	GMT-5	23	HTML, CSS, PHP, .NET, JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX), Python, Java, C++, C#, Fortran	I have my own private CS:GO server on a Linux box in my apartment for my friends/team to practice on. I'm fairly knowledgeable about configuring a server, but have never deployed public servers.	I've personally never been involved in it, but I think it's a nice thing to have for people that want it.	Generally a good resource.	I started playing Counter-Strike towards the end of 2013, a friend from grad school introduced it to me. I really enjoyed the competitive scene and the ability to consistently get better at the game. I follow the competitive scene very closely nowadays and spend a good deal of my leisure time watching or playing CS. In-game I have close to 800 matchmaking wins, ranked Global Elite, and I regularly play FaceIt as well (previously ESEA, but I am no longer supporting that service for privacy reasons).  I have a B.S. and M.S. in physics and I recently left a PhD program. I'm hoping to find and start a teaching job at the community college or high school level in August.	13-18 months	Fairly similar to most large online communities. A degree of toxicity and groupthink, but overall it functions well and people can have thoughtful comments/conversations without too much trolling. I do see well-formatted, thoughtful posts get downvoted pretty often because people don't know what downvoting is for, however this problem is not endemic to /r/GlobalOffensive. On the moderation side of things, I do think it can be a bit heavy-handed sometimes when it comes to new posts, I think the users should be given the opportunity to just speak with downvotes/upvotes on some "low value" content instead of posts just being removed outright by the mods.  I tend to get somewhat annoyed with a few popular opinions because I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to gameplay as you can see from my comment history. I would of course cease making mildly hostile comments/arguments if I were a moderator. 
5/31/2015 1:49:34	http://www.reddit.com/user/VirtualJordan/	UTC-5	20	No - (Some C++ and Python in high school, but nothing I'd be useful with!)	I used to admin for several large Minecraft servers for 'Hungercraft' and several servers on Garry's Mod 'Convict Gaming' servers.	Great idea! A lot of fun and a fantastic way to meet people and connect with the subreddit community.	I can't express how much I love Newbie Thursday. I have adopted a bunch of new players and I always point them to the threads for advice and to learn a couple things! So far, every one of them has appreciated it. I liked the idea so much that my other subreddit I morderate, /r/voiceacting, wants to adopt the same Newbie Thread Day schedule!	Hey there! I'm Jordan, a 20 year old college student in Chicago, Illinois. I work at a resturaunt and I am a voice actor! I already moderate two other subreddits (/r/voiceacting and /r/survivalgaming). On both of these subreddits, I am extremely active and work hard to make it a good community. I'm on reddit usually 1-4 hours a day, ranging from early in the morning to late into the night. I'm addicted to CS:GO. Been playing CS since I was 11, and was big into CSS. I also am very connected with the Ignite gaming lounge in chicago and am emailing valve about customer service positions. Feel free to message me on Reddit, or add me on skype (jordanjule@hotmail.com) if you would like to talk more!	10-12 months	Honestly, if I didn't like the community, I would not be applying. Sometimes I hate the circle-jerk of the community, but overall I like the balance of serious discussion and 'fluff' being posted. I'd love for Valve to connect more with the subreddit and the community, as it's the biggest CSGO community resource out there.
5/31/2015 1:52:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/jackinab0x	GMT+5:30	17	High school level C++	Admin a CS 1.6 Pub server currently and a private Minecraft server for the school.	Good initiative but only limited to EU and NA right now, Asia has a huge playerbase and FACEIT in SEA is larger than it is in NA atm.	Only good when there are some new and unique questions asked instead of the same being repeated every week by different users but as long as its helpful to the community, why not?	17 year old Highschool pass out with loads of free time on my hands, like playing Video games of all sorts (Console, PC etc). Huge fan of Halo, Game of Thrones.  Preparing for college atm  Hobbies include cycling, basketball, football(Soccer for you murican heathens), Swimming and FUT collection(It's almost like CSGO skins).	2-3 years	When I first started browsing the sub it was about 2 months before Arms Deal, we were a prety small sub and were excited about every little thing Valve did. Now its just a barge of complaints about Valve not doing their job.  People also bandwagon on anything negative really quickly instead of properly realising and understanding the situation along with lots of idea's about witch hunting being upvoted.  About mods, you guys are doing a great job no doubt but it would be great to have a thread every 2 weeks about changes to the subreddit (Like that banner competition).
5/31/2015 1:57:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/awesomised/	GMT+10	16	Irregular usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript.  Have dabbled in lua before.	I have no experience with CSGO servers in particular, But I have Co-Owned two Gmod servers (RP and Basewars)  I have also owned three servers on minecraft before. (ew what was I thinking?)	It seems like an amazing idea, But I myself have never been able to participate. It is an amazing idea to enable the community to play together in a game we all love.	I think it is a good way for people that are both new to the community and new to the game to help them along and become more comfortable in both situations.	Well, I am Declan, But I go by "Awesomised" online, I like to see myself as pretty intelligent. I am moving to the southern parts of Australia in about 3 months or so in hopes of pursuing an apprenticeship in the cooking industry, and hopefully I can find enough time on the side to try and dabble in IT. I enjoy live streaming, although I have had to put that on pause for a while, as the environment I am living in at the moment is too loud but that should hopefully be solved when I move to Tasmania. Making youtube videos is another objective I wish to pursue when I move.  I feel as if I am both very introverted and outgoing at the same time. For the most part I lurk around on reddit, But when talking to friends or team-mates, I never seem to be quiet. (Not sure if that is a good or bad thing aha). Whenever I am not sleeping, or at school, I am on my computer.	13-18 months	For the most part it is a fun community, Whilst there is a fair share of asshats, That is expected in everything. The subreddit is a pretty great place to go if you have questions. One of the only gripes I can think of right now with subreddit would be all of the goddamn shitposts everywhere.  The informative community and the fun posts only just manage to balance everything out ;)
5/31/2015 1:59:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/Keithen/	GMT-5	28	no	No	love it	Needs more help from good players	I got to much time off from work so i use the forums alot. I play CS about 100+ hours a week. I am a global elite and play in Main. Im mature and know alot about CS. Watch all pro games. Just looking for something to do while i lurk the fourms	19-24 months	i like it
5/31/2015 1:59:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/ryanxsj	GMT+10	18	Regular Java a long time ago.	I've owned very large forums / games before. Nothing in the last 8 months since I started cs:go though.	I'm unable to participate as far as I'm aware, given my location.	Very informative when I first started cs:go, occasionally helpful now too.	I understand I lack experience, but I've been on reddit for a long time as a lurker, I've been into gaming for 7 years and have lots of experience handling communities, as well as learning how to do things quickly.  This application is more of a timezone based one, as I know most positions require slots to be filled from my timezone, and I feel I could accommodate to that being from Australia.  Best of luck to other applicants.	7-9 months	I enjoy the content, very rarely post however. If required I'm happy to start doing so.  The comments always start an interesting discussion, and have changed my opinion on things sometimes.  The circlejerk of content lately has been annoying though. (CZ nerf, tec 9 OP, NA teams suck, hit boxes suck) as well as the top comments always relating to needing more music kits or skins, it was hardly funny the first time.
5/31/2015 2:08:16	http://www.reddit.com/user/Shootemout/	GMT-5	18	I took a college class in both basic Python and Java	I have been, and currently still, an admin for a former number one Garry's Mod server known as "Noobonic Plague" underneath the pseudoname "Milly Bays". The server is: 130.211.123.15:27017 and the owner of the server's profile, if you would like to reference, is http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinavestos/  I also own a Teamspeak server, it's only made for 10 people and usually is only filled with 4, it's just for me and my friends though I still "manage" it.	I like it, not too fond of a few of the people. Usually just keep my mouth shut and play though. I don't like causing, or stirring shit.		To start off, I suppose I should start with I'm an 18 year old guy who lives in central Texas just outside of Austin.  I don't really like to hide behind fancy words and prefer to be quite blunt. I view myself as patient (sometimes I'm quick to anger with CS:GO, but I usually calm down a few seconds later sure you guys know the dealio) and open minded. I enjoy all types of humour ranging from dark humour to silly puns. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I prefer to wait things out and lurk over comments than to comment and contribute, though I usually make exceptions. Especially if it's helping a new person or something that affects me. I admit, cussing is a guilty pleasure of mine but I don't mind changing that part.  I love to laugh and hate to be angry. Not much more than that. I love being silly with my friends or my partner, whether it be a girl or guy.  Computers have been my life, both of my parents taught me how to use computers at a very young age and have since been interested in how they work and the internet. I enjoy meeting new people and hanging out with old ones. I probably have a computer addiction, but hey, who doesn't?  I remember when I first played CS:GO, I thought it was shit and the people who played it were all dickheads. I was right about one. The game eventually got better, and the people never changed. Just my viewpoint on them. I didn't actually start playing till about Operation Bravo, quit CS:GO and got back in for Operation Bravo (bummed I missed Phoenix). I started out as Nova 3 and have since made my way up the ladder to Legendary Eagle.	13-18 months	I feel like it's a love hate relationship. I love some of the stupid shit that people come up with, the puns and all the "shitposts" but at the same time I dislike all the 'fragvids'. I feel they're too reminiscent of CoD. I love when every operation first comes out, or when an update first comes out, there's always some dude that finds cool or wack shit (i.e. the birds on train)

I feel like I could be probly the best moderator in training this world has ever seen if I got the chance. I'm a regular guy just like you yahoos and I have a lot of freetime recently since I'm unemployed and playing cs all day, figured I could help clean out all the shit thats seeping through the floorboards of this sub, really stem the tides of garbage if you will. 	19-24 months	The more people that come in and suggest the same shit over and over and over again the worse this sub is getting, more posts are starting with "does anyone else feel like blah blah 128 tick matchmaking good idea" and get to the front page I feel my braincells killing themselves with little knives. Very little constructive comments exist anymore is slowly devolving into random memes and pro worship like all of the other once great esports subs (lookin at you dota2). I feel like if i was the sheriff around here we wouldnt have lame ass twitter posts and dumb pics and memes and sticker and skin posts but the sub would be a graveyard devoid of any content other than Thorin's Thoughts videos and tournament results.

As you can see I am not that good in introductions so I am just gonna leave it like this	4-6 months	This community is a roller coaster. Some days its good, some days its bad. This can happen to any subreddit. This sub requires people who can deliver judgement without putting emotions in front of them. This is why I feel I am capable of doing that. I can put justice and put bias in it.

HTML, CS, JS, Python, SQL, etc.  In addition to VB, C#, Java, .NET	Nope	I've participated in a few.  Each one has been particularly well organized.  Especially the map testing nights.  I haven't really had any problems with how they were run.  I was assigned to a lobby and given a server IP/PW to connect to and was able to play a match on a new community map to test easily.  	Its a good idea to have a post, along with links to other subreddits to direct newer players to areas where they might be able to receive more specialized assistance or get answers for their specific questions.  Its also generally nice to have because it will prevent the actual subreddit from being filled with "noob" questions.    So to be able to keep all of these questions which many will find useless and just filler to one single weekly post allows content and news to be upvoted and seen by a greater number of people.  	I have been playing CS for about 6 years now.  I started with Source and was a very casual player who essentially played Dust 2 24/7 and Office 24/7.   I am now an SMFC and worked my way up from Silver 3.    I just graduated college in May.  I graduated with a Computer Information Systems degree.  I start work as a programmer at a commercial insurance firm on June 1st.  And I just ordered my first car.    I tend to be an avid redditor who frequents /r/globaloffensive /r/sneakers /r/streetwear and /r/subaru    I volunteered while at College to go to soup kitchens and help feed homeless people every Friday evening.  As well as playing Football.    I am honestly really happy that CS:GO did not die in the early stages of the game which were shaky.  I am a competitive person and CS is the only FPS game that is competitive right now.  I cannot stand to play MOBA'S competitively.  My ADHD will kick in during the minion farming because its so boring.    I have a genuine interest in seeing this community grow and I want to help people achieve their highest ability cap in the game.  I have even gone on to adopt/coach/teach many friends from school the game.    I am writing this at 2:17 AM and I am kind of just rambling on now.  I am going to go to sleep.    Goodnight.    P.S.

No.	I feel as though they are useful for communities to know and play with one another. However, I feel as though we need Australian nights too, maybe other regions.	Very useful, They offer a place for newcomers and even long winded players to Give/get advice and up their game. I feel it's very important and useful.	Hey guys, I'm a 15 Year old guy who enjoys using computers over doing anything else. I'm still maturing atm, and if I did get the Mod place I would, undeniably make a few mistakes during my time. However, Being young I actually have a lot of free time, and being part of such a growing community would give me something to use my time in. Uh-oh I'm off-topic. I try to be humble as much as I could, I have a really mixed sense of humor, Oldie and new :-) I'll make silly jokes every now and then that the old geezers would like and some the "freshies"(People my age)  would like. I am usually very calm and collected, I can speak reasonably and tread carefully when talking to aggravated and sensitive people, whilst still maintaining respect and Logic when speaking to someone. I feel as though this is not enough so I'd like to sum up how I think I could benefit this community through time and hard-work. Not to mention doing this would teach me more respect and maturity, it also would help me with my all-round talking and conferring my opinion with groups of people ( the other mods)  Here's how I can see the pro's to accepting my application: -Fast Learner -Hard worker ( AKA will put alot of my free time into this)  -Australian time Zone ( I'm aware you're looking for Australian mods)  -Young, so very impressionable ( AKA Would take after other mods and be molded into a formidable mod)  -Can admit, accept and take responsibility of mistakes, which inevitably would happen. -Mature, I may slip up occasionally, but I'm just being honest. I feel as though a heavy Majority of the time I would be fine and efficient. -Lot's and lot's of spare time. I can moderate on and off from 3:30 to about ~11 each night. Even a bit in the morning, I don't know the normal hours for mods but I imagine this is fitting as it fits majority of the Australian time zones.  -I would bring a new, Ideal to the team and community, ( Something like proving that your age doesn't necessarily mean your opinion is silly and invalid, maybe giving the Younger users something to strive for.)  -I am nice and would get along with the team. ( Hopefully!)   Cons to me -It is likely I will make a mistake, and then immediately think I would get removed from mod team or whatever, which is just my age. -I can be sensitive at times, which means I might slip up to certain comments. However this is just a possible con.  -I have a lot less experience. -I would definitely need a teacher to ease me into the exact actions you have to do as a mod, and how to decide whether to-or not to remove change something etc.  -Would need a small portion of another mods time to show me the  ropes.  There is probably more but I can't  think of them right now.  I don't post a lot compared to other users, however that Can change. I have been playing Counterstrike for roughly a year and have around 800 overall hours on it. I normally play for fun and am hovering around Gold Nova Master - MG2  My overall counterstrike Knowledge is most likely slightly above average.  I am not very popular in this community because I don't often post here, however that can Change.  I would really appreciate this opportunity to be part of something bigger than myself. It would make me a better and well-rounded person. I would also like to meet new people from around the world.   Thank you so much for your time Reading this, and I hope I at least get considered, Thank you so much! Have a lovely evening. 	4-6 months	Our community, In my eyes, is actually a lot more nice/forgiving than other communities. I haven't been around that ridiculously long, but from what I have seen there is a very little amount of hate and disrespect. A lot of comments that are opinions that are opposed by the community usually give good insight and reasoning, without fighting and arguing. So far in my time I haven't seen anything against the rules of reddit or the subreddit being broken, therefore I can assume the Mods are very active and sharp with their work. I like how you can be honest about your skills, and what you flaw in this sub without the fear of getting hated on. Even if you did get hated on, people would normally stick up for you. I respect how everyone is here, and personally i feel it tops a lot of other subreddit's in that way. You know how people on the internet are :-) 
5/31/2015 2:25:54	http://reddit.com/u/theclarinetsoloist	GMT-6	17	Basic understanding of:  HTML PHP CSS Java	none	Community Night is, in my opinion, the most unique feature of this subreddit compared to other game-specific subreddits. By getting people together, regardless of skill-level or anything else, the subreddit forms a much stronger and tightly-knit community.	Newbie Thursday is a very important part of this subreddit. As /r/GlobalOffensive is one of the largest CSGO fansites on the internet, what happens here has a direct effect on the growth of the game itself. By creating a haven to help new players learn the game and improve, this subreddit is encouraging players to purchase the game and improve on their own.  Although I rarely comment, many of the tips I have learned from these threads have helped me since I first started playing. In fact, I had never played an FPS game before CSGO, so I started in Silver 1, and now I am Silver Elite, in just a few months.	Hi, my name is Rohan, and I am /u/theclarinetsoloist on reddit. I would like to apply for a moderator position here on /r/GlobalOffensive, because this community has done so much in shaping my interest in CSGO, a game which I was hesitant about at first, and I would like to return the favor by performing the role of moderation.  I would make an excellent moderator due to my experience and my level-headedness. I moderate on two relatively large subreddits, /r/Clarinet (2k subscribers) and /r/Hearthstone (250k subscribers). My 6 months as a moderator of /r/Hearthstone is especially relevant as I have experience dealing specifically with gaming communities. As a result of my reddit moderating experience, I am familiar with managing modmail, modqueue, and the moderator tools and forums (/r/ModNews, /r/SnooGaming).  In terms of my approach to moderation, I prefer a hands-off approach, letting the voting system do its job, but intervening in the case of broken rules. In terms of discussion, I remain objective, keeping my personal convictions separate from my duty to be transparent and unbiased. In discussions with the other Hearthstone mods, I often play the devil's advocate, voicing the more unpopular opinions at least to force the team to think critically and prevent us from making a hasty, biased decision.  I also believe in utilizing the moderator role as a way to engage the subreddit, as evidenced by my leading role in the /r/Hearthstone Best of 2014 Contest, and the 200k Subscriber Snoo Design Competition. As a moderator of /r/Hearthstone, I have been through my fair share of drama, and know how to handle it. Most recently, I cleared up the situation surrounding a certain YouTuber's channel ban and also responded to many of the questions raised in response.  I do spend a significant amount of time on reddit, actively browsing for 3-4 hours a day. Aside from that, I have modmail notifications on my phone, so the moderation role is never too far away. However, there are many things I do outside from moderating. I am a senior in high school, graduating in about two weeks. In college I will be studying Biomedical Engineering. I have played the clarinet for seven years now (hence the username). I am an avid gamer, playing League of Legends, Hearthstone, and CSGO all about equally. I also volunteer at a local hospital, with over 250 hours to date.  Thank you for all you do as moderators, I know it is a very thankless job, and people are eager to point out the few mistakes without realizing how much is being done correctly. As shown by the current disaster at /r/LeagueofLegends, having an understanding and mutualistic relationship between moderators and users is of great importance to maintain a healthy subreddit.  I thank you for reviewing my application and I hope you consider me for a position here at /r/GlobalOffensive.  Rohan, /u/theclarinetsoloist	0-3 months	When a lot of my friends started playing CSGO, I was intrigued by the game, but hesitant to buy a game which costs money, unlike League of Legends and Hearthstone (although I have spent a fair share of money on those games too). But I did subscribe to this subreddit and watch a lot of the gameplay videos and fun stuff, as well as look at the Twitch streams which were featured on the sidebar. Eventually, what I saw here motivated me to want to play the game myself.  One of the things that amazes me about this game is how friendly the users are. Reading through comment threads, it is not uncommon to see a person with a high rank flair (SMFC/GE/etc), conversing with a Silver/Gold. Despite the massive skill difference, the users just ignore it and there are no ill feelings or insults between them ("shut up you are just a noob" for example). Obviously no community is free from animosity between members, but the moderation team is active enough that I never see those kind of things pollute comment threads.
5/31/2015 2:26:53	http://reddit.com/u/CrusaderPistol	GMT+4	17	I've had experience with Java and HTML before but not enough to say that I have full knowledge of the subjects.	I used to host scrims as a private server of my own for my friends and I to play on. Localy hosted I mean. So because of that, I know most of the commands needed for changing game settings, changing modes, workshop maps, and even move from one game mode to the other (1v1 to 10v10, aim maps, etc) all in-game.   	I really do believe that Community night is simply, fucking amazing, I mean, if a map is worth while playing Let the community test it!  One of the best Ideas of the subreddit.	I never had to use/look at Newbie Thursday threads because they weren't available at the time of me playing as a silver (needed any help).  But, It is perfect for new players to have their questions answered for them. I mean, I posted a thread sometime ago asking about CFGs and Launch options. I've had one of the mods even post his! This helped me greatly and I would like to help more players get started.	I'm fluffy. I'm smart. I'm lovable.   Plus I'm a good guy to count on for anything.	13-18 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is a mix of bitter and sweet. The game is of the heart and mind. But the community is amazing as well. People help each other actually, not like other crap communities where they make fun of players that are new and don't know how to play the game (looking at you LoL). I mean, this subreddit put me to the right track and pointed out my mistakes for me. I learned a lot of stuff here including wallbangs, smokes, flashes, launch options that are needed, the importance of CFGs, and even learned that NiP is the best team in the world (I follow my heart <3). /r/GlobalOffensive is an amazing community and I will be absolutely honored to Mod it.
5/31/2015 2:41:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/EXtremeLTU/	GMT+2	18	No experience in coding.	I have admined many servers on CS:1.6, but don't have that much experience in admining CS:GO Servers.	That's great idea, but i haven't participated yet.	That's a great way for newbies to get quick answers for their questions without reading guides or F.A.Qs. It helps them to get quicker into game.	Not much about me. i would consider myself patient when needed. I like order and rules being followed. On my free time i like to play video games, mostly Counter-Strike. I also like to watch pro matches. After every match i watch or play i like to come and lurk in  /r/GlobalOffensive subredit. Actually, one of the first things i do in the morning is checking /r/GlobalOffensive. I'm not fluent in english but i'm good enough to express my thoughts. 	7-9 months	Community seems friendly and supportive. Anytime you see a new thread with newbie questions, you can see that it was already answered by experienced players. Of course not everyone is that friendly or supportive. There are some salty people or trolls, but they get downvoted real quick and they don't get that much recognition.
5/31/2015 2:48:38	http://www.reddit.com/user/condsant/	GMT+1	27	Very minor CSS to the point of being irrelevant	1.6 yes, GO none.	I think it is a good idea and the community feedback seems to be generally positive, i do not have any personal experience with them.	I think its good mod-generated content, its function to gather frequently asked questions under a recurring submission is a great idea.	Il be honest and go to the nitty gritty ASAP to save you time. If i as a mod of /r/GlobalOffensive would be required to participate as a player or share my steam/personal information then count me out. Im a bit adamant to keep my personal gaming life and other open forums seperate, especially if its connected to me as a moderator.   What i am willing to share as far as personal information goes is my age and country of origin which is sweden. I would perhaps further down the line be willing to participate as a ingame presence but if it bars me as a moderator at the get go then throw me in the decline pile :)  If you are still reading il rabble on a bit more. I started playing CS in beta 5 somewhere i belive and played a fair amount in 1.6. Very minor gametime in source and now in GO i must admit i spend more time reading/watching CS than playing it.  As far as reddit moderation goes i am a moderator of /r/truegaming which is a moderate-small sized sub. I have been a mod for a bit over 2 months in said sub and have during my time learned a great deal on some of the ins and outs of moderating.   If i were to become a moderator of /r/GlobalOffensive then that would most likely be the max amount of subs i would be willing to moderate. As a redditor i am more of a lurker which spends most of my time on /r/games, /r/truegaming /r/sweden and /r/GlobalOffensive.  As a moderator on /r/GlobalOffensive i would outside of the given duties be willing to communicate and engage with the modteam through reddit/IRC/Voicechat and help contribute in making the sub a more enjoyable place. I consider myself mature, calm, easy going and open for discussion/feedback.  I have some questions on certain topics related to /r/GlobalOffensive but i will save those if you find me interesting as a candidate. If not me then i hope you find someone that shares your vision on where to take /r/GlobalOffensive and helps keep if the great place it currently is! GLHF.	13-18 months	The CS community and competetive communities overall tend to be pretty bad on several points. Its hard to put a blind eye as these aspects tend to shine through in /r/GlobalOffensive. However given its context i feel like a good amount of submissions and comments on /r/GlobalOffensive are either enjoyable or informational and i use it as one of my most frequently visited sites.
5/31/2015 3:01:10	http://reddit.com/u/ApplesToFapples	GMT-5	17	Finished Web Design 1 and AP Computer Science where we learned how to use Java.

I also find some helpful information I didn't know quite frequently!	Im hardworking and can help with whatever I'm needed for.  I've always been really interested in helping out the CS community and hopefully this is how I could do so!  Thanks for this opportunity!	2-3 years	I love the community!  I've always felt that it's awesome that we all have the same interest in something!  I'd be glad to help in anyway I can!
5/31/2015 3:03:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/plonkyy/	GMT+10	21	I have some very basic knowledge in Java, probably not enough to claim I have relevant experience. 	I was a main admin on a number of CSS servers in Australia before CS:GO was released. These included a few pug servers, public TDM servers and one bhop server. This included servers that ran the old Mani Admin Plugin before Sourcemod really broke out as the main plugin. I also frequently rented my own 11 slot server for teams that I participated in. This included having full FTP / CPanel access where I setup everything myself and administrated the servers through the likes of using HLSW. In CS:GO, I have rented one server for a team I was in where I did the above, having full access. The servers file structure is practically the same and very easy to run with some experience. I also run my own Mumble server (rented) which is used by my friends, teams, and other members of the community who ever want a place to chill, usually for friends of friends since it is only a 15 slot server.	I think Community Night was a great idea, its simple yet it brings players and community's together. I still remember being new in the CSS days, and something like this would of been a huge advantage to myself and others instead of having to go through IRC. I think its important for new players to find other kind people to play with, otherwise if they are considering taking the game that little bit more serious, they would really struggle in doing that by playing alone all the time. So full props to the idea!	Just like Community Night I think this is another great idea, it really makes the newer players feel comfortable in asking questions they think may sound stupid or pointless. I've even directed my own friends to the threads because I usually see people giving friendly and informative answers, yet at the same time not over confusing the new players. It's also not just good for Newbie's, reading the thread myself you will always see an answer to something you didn't know yourself!	G'day, I'm Josh, and I am 21 years old from Melbourne, Australia! I have been playing the Counter-Strike series seriously since 2009. I played 1.6 when I was a young kid here and there, but once I played Source I was hooked. I played around 3000 hours of Source before quitting in 2012 due to it being my final year of high school. I then took the plunge and started playing GO at the end of 2013 after telling everyone I would never play it. I hated the look of it when it first came out, so it's really amazing to see how far it has come. I love the whole esports idea, and love watching it. If im home and I'm not playing CS, I'm watching it on Twitch! I get pretty hyped especially when an Australian team is playing, even when they aren't I'll stay up till the early hours of the morning due to my timezone, watching tournaments and surfing the subreddit.   Anyway besides gaming, I am currently taking a break from University (College) and working Part-Time as an Assistant Chef. In school my major was Journalism and Politics. I loved writing essays in school and I was always good at them. I also love helping others out, not just in CS, but in anything in life. I'm the guy my friends come to when they need help with something, I just like giving back to other people, you know?   My activity, I am usually on the subreddit for many hours of the day, a lot of them I might just be browsing, but as a fan of Reddit in general I am on here a lot, and will participate in a post that I find interesting / important. I also always find myself not being able to sleep for an hour or two because I will be on Reddit on my phone in bed!  Well, that's a bit about myself :P	7-9 months	I think the GlobalOffensive subreddit is pretty good at the moment. There's  some great content posted on there and, most of the time, there is a lot of insightful and helpful members posting. I don't think it has changed that much over the months that I have been active in the subreddit, maybe besides there being more community driven projects, such as people giving back to the community for helping them. Example the Newbie Thursday series, and the CSGO Bootcamp service that was just released. I think the current mods are doing a pretty good job, and not saying that to "suck up" or anything, but from my experience I haven't seen anything unfairly removed and such, I guess that doesn't mean it hasn't happened but from my experience they have done a good job. It could get tougher though with how popular the subreddit is getting.
5/31/2015 3:05:38	http://reddit.com/u/Daniel543M	GMT+10	19	I absolutely do. I'm currently in my second year studying Software Engineering.   I've done a Web Programming course where we used HTML, XHTML, HTML5, Javascript, PHP and CSS (I also used a bit of RegEx for an assignment).  I've also done courses in: Java, C, Perl, OpenGL, SQL, and more.  That's about it for coding that I can remember from the top of my head right now.  In one of my more recent courses, we've been dealing with Regular Expressions in great detail.	I do, but not CS:GO related. I used to be a staff member on a fairly large Minecraft server. It was owned by a popular YouTuber and I was selected from many, many applicants to become staff and then I ended up with one of the highest positions available.   Personally I think staffing a server like that is very difficult because we have to be focused on the chat at all times with hundreds and hundreds of people typing at the same time. As you can imagine, the server was mainly filled with obnoxious youngsters who would constantly break the rules and I had to deal with almost each and every one in a fair way.  The server also had an online forum where people could ask questions and post 'complaints' or pictures or anything like that and I was very active on that (which is more similar to a subreddit).	Not a big fan. At first it didn't really suit my time zone but I really haven't ever truly been a part of one.	I quite like them. They are fairly informative most of the time, although I don't check it out every time.	So my name is Daniel. I'm a 19 year old guy, born and raised in Victoria, Australia. The first shooter game I ever bought was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 after I won a $100.00 debit card in a competition. Ever since then I have been a 'gamer'. Started with CoD, then started playing different games. A couple of my friends played CS & CSS and they would always show me the 'surfing' servers and I'd have no idea what was going on, but it was cool. Then when CS:GO came out, I played on my friends computer a lot until I thought I was remotely OK at the game and decided I'd buy it for myself.  In terms of 'IRL' stuff, I used to play Tennis, Soccer (and Futsal), Basketball & Table Tennis (I also love mini golf, but then again; who doesn't). I had to quit because unfortunately I didn't really have the time.   Ever since I was young, my friends considered me a "computer wizard". I was always top of the class in my IT classes in high school and people were always impressed with what I could do on the computer. That's sort of how my Bachelor of Software Engineering came about. When I finished High School (with a score I was very happy with), I figured that considering the fact that the majority of my life involves computers and technology, why not study it. So I'm, happy what I'm doing, despite it's difficulty.  With Uni break coming up, 2 of my friends and I are going to actually get started in starting up our own business. We've always had it in our minds that we don't really want to be working for someone in the future. We want to sort of be our own bosses, so after many hours of meetings,chatting and thinking, we've got ourselves an idea and a plan and we're about to get going as something on the side.  That being said, I still have a part time job stocking shelves at a supermarket...  I have a Dog (Golden Retriever) named Cookie who was named by my sister after, on the way home from the pet store, we drove past a McDonalds that had a sign out the front for their cookies.  Oh and I'm the middle child of 3 with 2 sisters.  I like movies and TV shows and long walks on the beach (that's a joke but not really).  But yeah, that's about it I reckon. I think that was wordy enough while covering the basics of me.  Thanks for reading and for your consideration :) Have a good one, - Daniel	7-9 months	I like us. It seems to me that everyone here is a lot more friendly and less hostile than, say, /r/Dota2. Although I don't post much, I browse it multiple times a day and find it very amusing and helpful. The 'New' section is far better than that of /r/Dota2 (whether that's because of better mods or better posters, I can't tell). I have no issues with any mods or users so I have nothing to criticize in that regard, however I'd also like to see something like the "Weekly Stupid Questions Thread" that /r/Dota2 do. Those are hilarious and I can't imagine anyone disliking it. They are for funny questions which may seem stupid but are really interesting or can be actually stupid questions with stupid answers.

I would like to become a moderator, because I would like to engage more in the community and become a bigger part of it. Even though I have never had experience in moderating, I believe that my leadership skills can be very helpful to the team. Thank you!	2-3 years	Overall it has been helpful to me because I have learned a lot of new things about the game. Also I am able to keep up with exciting things happening in the E-Sports scene. The only negative thing about the community is the bashing of Silvers or noobs, I feel as though we should help them get better at the game instead of driving them away.
5/31/2015 3:15:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/jamieede	GMT+0	26	I'm a web developer & server admin by trade. So knowledgeable in HTML(5), php, js, & server admin wise bash, management etc. http://jamieede.co.uk my blog, http://jamieede.com my cv site	Yes HIGHLY experienced. Had over 20 CSS servers at one point, with custom coding. I even created my own UNIQUE zriot server that was highly popular. With bosses & special powers and the such. CSGO wise I have run 3 in total. Only one up right now which is a TDM rpg  The hosting environment was my own rented servers. Dedicated. Minimum spec of i5 processor & 16GB RAM	Anything that causes involvement of the community itself is always positive. It's a win win.	Getting the newbies involved is obviously great. Without it the community would dwindle. Getting involvement will further grow our community	Well I'm 26. Married. Kids. From the UK (South East). Spend most of my waking life on my laptop or iPhone. One or the other with reddit open and playing CSGO... When the weather is great I do like to go in the garden. Take the laptop out there and play csgo or play Spotify and play with the children. So yeah. I'm not your average redditor. I'm also always looking for freelance work (I know being a mod is voluntary) whether it be web dev, server management, game server hosting etc etc.   You can email me at ede.jamie@gmail.com	0-3 months	The community as a whole is an enjoyable place to be. Always critical of game breaking bugs. Positive influences & engagement in topics from funny moment gifs to real user concerns. I'm glad to be a part of it all
5/31/2015 3:26:51	https://www.reddit.com/user/MaxStavro/	UTC-8	17	No I do not have any experience.	I am admin of multiple TS and Mumble servers but not a website nor a CS server.	I think it is a great way to take everyone's minds off of the toxic aspect of the player base and it is a good way to find groups of people to play with.	I enjoy answering questions although I have only answered 2-3 on Newbie Thursday. I usually answer a lot of questions when someone asks them in the New tab.	I am turning 18 this July CS is the only game I play and I would love to go pro some day. One of my hobbies is computer building I am not serious about it but I have built a few for my friends and I. I am currently on the team Global Warming I think we can make it big with our team work or lets just hope haha. Since I just graduated HS I currently do not have a job so I will be on reddit a lot so you don't have to worry about me not helping or adding to admin discussions. Thanks!	13-18 months	I think it is a great way to ask questions and answer them. I mainly use it to answer since I am not new to the game (for some I might be). I enjoy helping others in threads on my own time and I am usually checking Global offensive more than I do facebook now. I enjoy some of the fluff but I think we can clean up some of the repeat threads about current issues in the game and people complaining.
5/31/2015 3:28:13	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheKamaD/	UTC+1	20	I study game programming, so I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, some experience in using JavaScript and PHP, and a decent, but expanding knowledge of Java, C# and C++.		I think Community Night is a great event. It opens up a lot of possibilities for new players to learn the game, as well as giving experienced players a place to hang out, play with new people and share strats. 	I've been lurking Newbie Thursday threads for a while, occasionally contributing, and I have never seen a community more helpful than ours when it comes to helping out new players. I have personally used these threads as pointers for my own gameplay, as well at coaching my fellow teammates with tips and tricks from these threads. 	I am a Norwegian student (as stated previously) and I have since an early age had a passion for video games of all genres.  Currently, I am unemployed, studying full time and playing CS:GO as a hobby with my team.  In terms of personality, I suppose I could say I'm open-minded, patient and  calm. I love working with a team of others and I'm able to work under most circumstances.  When it comes to moderator qualities, I have never been a moderator, but being a programmer I pay attention to details, use the guidelines as specified and I'm not afraid to ask for help should I be clueless.	7-9 months	As I stated in the previous question, I think the community is very helpful towards new players. It's a lot of fun reading through discussion threads and see the reactions of different opinions.  There is a lot of constructive feedback from the community, but also the occasional toxicness when it comes to certain topics. The toxic behaviour has been less and less visible, so I believe both the mods and the community has improved in many ways. 
5/31/2015 4:16:28	http://reddit.com/user/xxxxxlordyxxx	UTC+10:00	16	Yes, I don't code really any more but when I did I coded in javascript. I coded game servers (minecraft mainly) but this was a few years ago. I have also coded the tiniest bit of HTML but I am no where near as good as I was at javascript. I have an HTML/PHP coded website but I am just an administrator for the site and didn't help code much.	Never been an admin for a CS:GO server, but I have been admin/moderator for other game servers. 	Well seeing as I am in Australia, the server connection and timezone make it very difficult to participate. I would love to join if I could though.	I think it is very a very useful way for players to communicate without being sledged for lack of knowledge. Even as a knowledgeable cs:go player myself, I have asked a few questions there.  I  also tend to check it every now and then to see if any new questions have arisen but the rest of the community always beats me to it. It's great to see such an engaged and supporting community.	Well I am a 16 year old Australian dude and in my final year of high school. I am actively on this subreddit for most hours of the day but unfortunately cant play much cs:go because I need to focus on school. I am pretty much always on reddit/the internet in general in my spare time because I have no life. I mostly lurk on this sub and most of my reddit activity is counter-strike related. I am active on reddit for about 19 hours of the day (of course not all day every day, this is just my time distribution)  If you would like to know some more personal stuff about me: - I enjoy playing waterpolo, soccer and swimming and dislike school work.  - I have an awesome job working in a cafe as a waiter/barrister. - All the "x's" in my reddit username is a joke because I am really mature and spent way too much of my early reddit days on /r/montageparodies - I guess you could say I am very sarcastic and have a sense of humour, but I can be serious.  I want to be a moderator because I am well affiliated with the reddit/subreddit rules, have been an active member on this sub and know what kinds of posts are received positively and negatively from personal experience as well as being a bystander. I can be active on the subreddit throughout the day and I will have a lot of spare time coming up in my school holidays and after I finish school in a few months. I love answering questions and helping people. I am kind and know how to control my behaviour. I believe I can make a big impact mostly on question threads as well as the sub in general because I have a lot of experience with the game, I know it inside out (sorry if I sound like i'm boasting but I mean it. I am a bit of a nut when it comes to csgo stats/information).  Thanks for taking the time to read and consider my application!  ~lordy 	7-9 months	I have been active on this sub for around 9 months now and to me I don't think it has that changed much (apart from the new layouts and banners :p). I think fluff posts are becoming much more prominent but I don't mind that really because they create a lot of active discussion. I believe this is because the game/technology/the internet is evolving quite quickly and rather than posting updates and facts about the game like it was when this sub just started, people tend to share their own/others uniquely created content.
5/31/2015 4:54:05	https://www.reddit.com/user/Gennix1337/	UTC+1	17	Not currently, but I'm studying IT, so I'll probably learn at least the basics of those listed above.	No, sadly not.	I think it's a good Idea for people looking to have some fun, but I myself have never actually participated in a Community Night.	I think it's a really, really good Idea to have something like Newbie Thursday.  It was fun to read when I was new myself and I guess it also helps to prevent that too much new posts with simple questions get submitted to the sub. I also think that even as an experienced player you can sometimes learn some new stuff from even better players.	So, where do I start ... I'm Nico, a 17 year old dude from Germany, currently studying IT. I'm also helping out at a local supermarket. I guess you could say I'm pretty chill and I don't have problems working in a team. I'm also able to work independently, just explain what I have to do and I'll get it done. I'm able to speak and understand English and German (Who would've thought?) and I can understand some Dutch, since I'm living at the border to the Netherlands. I'm also really interested in science, especially astrophysics. Oh, and tanks, I like tanks. I have lots of freetime, so helping you guys with moderating the sub wouldn't be a problem. I started gaming when I was 6 or 7 (Well, I secretly played GTA at one of my brothers friends place). Before Cs I mainly played CoD (1,2,WaW) and Battlefield (3 and 4). Then I played some Cs 1.6 and source at some kids LAN, but never got hooked. Shortly after Cs:Go came out I bought it and really got into it. And now I'm here playing Cs every day :)  I've already gone through all of this while applying as a Faceit admin, with the (now ex-) community manager not getting back to me after the final interview, so hopefully I have more luck here. If not, well it was worth a try :)	13-18 months	Well, I might be wrong, but I don't remember so much Fluff being posted ~1 year ago. I mean, if people are interested in all the Fluff-posts, I don't have a problem with that, but since I'm more interested in the competetive scene and improving all the Fluff is sometimes really annoying... but hey as I said, the sub is for the people to share stuff and have fun, not about what I want.  Another thing that has changed is all the inside jokes about the pro scene that we have in the sub. Every time stuff like the mouse lifting or other stuff comes up I just have to smile. Back when the sub was smaller those things were really rare. As for the mods, I've never had problems with them and as far as I know some of them are really helpful.
5/31/2015 4:31:07	http://reddit.com/u/Terklton	UTC+2	18	No.	No. I feel like I'm failing the test^^	That's an cool idea. Playing as a premade team is awesome and even more so when your teammates from the subreddit you're frequent on. I never participated, though, because I'm a member of a clan (playing for fun), and I usually have someone to play with.	It seems to be not that popular and questions tend to be repeated over and over, but the chance to get a reply on something you're curious about by a complete stranger must feel good. Hopefully, Newbie Thursday will get more popular for the game is getting more popular. 	My name's Igor (Игорь), I'm from Russia. Let me start by saying that I don't like the attitude towards Russian community in CSGO, but I can live with it. Consider myself polite and kind person, hoping to do something while sitting at home all the time^^. I never rage, so don't worry about it. Been playing csgo for almost 400 hours and played a lot of 1.6 before that. I don't know what else to say, so I'll wrap it up. Cheers.	0-3 months	Let's start with what I don't like. I don't like gifs. Especially ones that are over 100mb. I believe such gifs should be made into videos. But what I like about the sub is that it's hilariously funny (well, most of reddit is) and at the same time very smart. I mean, if you open any thread like 'Insane KennyS' ace' the top comment will make you laugh, and the second top will explain how that happened. Like it.
5/31/2015 4:35:18	http://reddit.com/user/r3boundx	UTC+10	18	learning html, java,python and anything else that will be useful when i leave high school. Still studying, so i doubt  so i doubt i would be much help in this field.  	No.	I'm in Australia so i really can't join. I do think it's a good idea though, and I'd love to play.  Too bad i suck with 20 ping , so i would probably suck even worse on higher ping.  	I think only users with genuine questions should be asked on that thread. It seems like there is more and more users using that thread to vent e.g. hitboxes broken and stuff. Though i do like having Newbie Thursdays every week. Definitely helps the commnuity.	I'm 18, Australian with a lot of time to browse reddit.Have a shit sleeping schedule, so i have that going for me.  Currently doing my senior year of high school and soon to get whooped when exams roll in.  Dream job is becoming a freelancer preferably in web design or a job that lets me travel.  I play sport recreationally. Swimming, running etc. I read dystopian novels. I play counter-strike (kek)  P.S. Have fun reading these applications. Good luck mods in choosing.	10-12 months	As the community gets bigger and bigger, naturally you'd get more and more players being more vocal about aspects of the game that they do not enjoy. I guess that's one whats really changed about it. /r/globaloffensive is no longer being used as a medium to spread exciting content about the game. There seems to be an anti-Valve rising as Valve seemingly makes more and more decisions that players don't agree with. Why not enjoy the game for what it is?   The community is growing, that's a plus.  
5/31/2015 4:42:46	http://reddit.com/u/topittaja	UTC+3	17	No	I have been admin in Finnish 24/7 Jailbreak server for 2-3 months now. 	They seem funny, but i have had no chance participating in any of them.	That's alot fun, i have been answering to alot questions there and have only positive experience about newbie thursday.	I am 17 years old boy from Lahti, Finland.   I am active CS player, and i have lurked alot in /r/globaloffensive.  My freetime hobby has been football since i was 9 years old.  I love animals and especially cats (We have three of them)	10-12 months	It's mostly very good and positive community, but sometimes  i see some people being VERY racist/toxic, but it is pretty rare too. Very well done by mods so far in my opinion.
5/31/2015 4:51:18	http://www.reddit.com/user/PoLVieT/	GMT+2	16	Unfortunately, no. I have very basic knowledge of HTML which allows me only to create bare-boned webpages.		Very nice idea. Pretty great for meeting people with the same interest.	Would appreciate if more people browsed it and answered questions.	Highschool student living in Poland. Family comes from Vietnam. I have been interested in Counter-Strike since I was 9 years old. It started with my schoolmate inviting me to his house and showing me the 1.6, I was so fascinated by the game that I stayed so late at his house. Obviously my parents berated me pretty hard.  The following years through the rest of elementary school were filled with playing 1.6 in the Internet Cafes until my parents finally allowed me to buy my own copy of the game. Years passed and eventually my cousin bought for me Counter-Strike: Source for my 12th birthday. I still remember being very frustrated installing it. Couldn't log into my account with 1.6, so I made new one which is the "main" account now.  Middle school years passed by with occasional Zombie Escapes on Source which were very fun, one of the reasons I wanted to have Source. One day my classmate approached me with gaming magazine and showed me an article about next iteration of Counter-Strike. Needless to say, I was pretty hyped but completely forgot about open beta. After hearing that CS:GO would be available only on digital platform I have lost entire hype I had. My internet was pretty slow and I didn't have any ways to buy through Steam store. Until I learned about PaySafeCards and after tasting CS:GO during ESWC 2012 free weekend, I bought my own copy of CS:GO and one for my cousin, the very same cousin who had bought me CS:S. And from ESWC 2012 I have been regularly playing CS:GO to this day. I think I have about 1.5k hours in CS:GO.   I visit /r/GlobalOffensive quite often. Whenever I go to reddit, the first thing I do is checkinh /r/GO. Whenever I have enough knowledge to answer to certain question I try my best to give best answer I can muster.  As for CS:GO pro scene, I really like watching pros intereacting with each other e.g. Olof vs Pasha or TaZ tournaments vlogs on his Facebook fanpage.   Besides CS:GO I am kind of a weeb, watching anime shows on the same day they air, grabbing new manga chapters day after they have been translated and playing... *certain* games. Also I am really into history and PC hardware. There was a certain period of time when I was interested in cardistry and magic tricks, I am still interested but not as much as I was back then.   As for my personality, I am usually silent type who tries to not make enemies. I try to take neutral stand and objectively form my own opinion based on what I know. The downside of my personality that sometimes I can't take decision for myself and usually need opinion of others to take that decision.   I think this is wordy enough. Did I mention that I lift my mouse pretty good? For the mod who has read my entire application, thank you. Keep up the nice work mods!   Cheers, 	13-18 months	Too much shitposts. But it is the cost of being somewhat large community. I don't want mods to be literally nazi and remove every post that may count as shitpost but the amount of low effort post for cheap laughs is seriously concerning. 
5/31/2015 4:56:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/Pazn737	GMT+10	16	No	I was a moderator for my couzins minigames server back in Source	Sounds fun although that would depend on day	very good considering the influx of people coming after watching tourneys etc	Im an outgoing guy who likes music football games and making music	7-9 months	They deserve better from valve but they also can be abit toxic
5/31/2015 5:00:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/wholesomememes	GMT+10	19	I did Javascript in software design during my school years, but not enough to speak of.	I moderated a community server designed for aim 1 v 1s. Obviously that isnt admining a server, but I thought i ought to include it ;)	Community night is a great way to introduce cohesion with the sub reddit. It has the potential to provide players with new opportunites at discovering active people to play counter strike with. Unfortunately, the community nights are usually based in NA. Being based in Australia limits these opportunities; something I would like to change.	Newbie Thursday is fantastic. The more people we rope in to Counter Strike through assistive information and measures, the better the community fairs as a whole. 	I am studying Law in Melbourne. Currently living with my father, I do not work. This means that i am quite freely available. My time is usually spent on either University or at Home studying, and Counter Strike.  I would be interested in becoming a moderator to improve the organisation of the reddit. I have a personal goal of furthering Counter Strike in its competitive and casual form within Australia; moderating is a medium for this. Obviously you guys receive many many submissions from people who will go on and on and on about why they should become moderators. I dont really feel that is necessary.   Honestly, I want to improve Counter Strike in Australia. Moderating the reddit is an integral part of this. It isnt just a want to gain power within a large community; cs:go is my passion and I want to further it. If you guys are looking for someone who is interested in bringing a cs-developing region of the world closer within the community as a whole, perhaps I can be of assistance. :)	10-12 months	I started getting seriously into /r/ Global offensive about a year ago. Back then the game and the sub reddit was a fraction of what it is now. I can only imagine the comparison between the early days to 2015. The community has grown, and like any popular hobby, has its variance in users. Obviously many people are inappropriate, toxic or whatever. However I feel that CS:GO has by far the best user base out of any currently widely used game. Specifically, the Sub Reddit is even better. Many of these toxic players dont even participate.   I see the /r/GlobalOffensive community as a fairly decent group of users. I cannot realistically think of anything that requires improvements, when one takes into account the relative context.
5/31/2015 5:02:39	http://www.reddit.com/user/Kristian146/	GMT+10	16	nope i only code with sum d4nk memes	Yeah i moderated face it for 16 years	siq lads play it, must bring in cheeky nandos afterwards though 	fuck noobs, get bitches and get skins mudda fukka 	i swear im duh dankest cuz out  http://i.imgur.com/y0AgY1X.jpg siq karambit i made, can show proof if needed,  i main on the wildy but i also fuck bitches in the memetime at mg1 i swear im good.  therefore i love cs go, bitches and money/skins  if you do mod me i will literally suck your dick(jpon im looking at you ;) ) 	4-6 months	fulla siq cuntz an siq mods amaright

I was S1 so i have PLENTY of knowledge and other stuff. I am the worst better in the world. I like my skins because they put me near the top of the csgo hierachy. 	4-6 months	Friendly community that enjoys silver contents and gameplay. Community has ALOT of useful information
5/31/2015 5:11:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/reservereverse	UTC+1	24	I've played around with HTML, C++ and VB (so I can whip up those gui interfaces for my csi team) but I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination.	I was an admin many years ago for a 1.6 cs militia only server. We had a pretty active UK community so the server was filled for most of the evening.   I'd love to pretend it kept me busy, but honestly it was a very tight knit group of the same players who just had fun. All I ever had to do was throw out the odd banhammer for hackers/people breaking our conduct rules. Oh, and explain why we wouldn't change the map!	It's not something I've joined personally but I bet a lot of people have awesome fun. Plus it helps build a greater sense of community on the sub so I'm all for it!	I think they're great. I love reading through them and grabbing a few new hints to try. No matter how long you play for, someone else can always teach you something new. They're a great addition to the sub.	When I'm not lurking various subreddits I spend my day at work (definitely not redditing) where I'm a senior sales advisor/assistant manager.    I wouldn't pretend much of my sales skill would carry over to a mod position, but it does demand people skills and given the flack that mods often get, the ability to handle people is an invaluable skill. Plus, it would be nice to help out, even in the background, with a sub I spend every day on.  Many thanks for reading and sorry for any mobile errors. I'm a at work. Ha,  Reservereverse 	0-3 months	I've been a long time lurker and even though I choose not to post very often I have watched it evolve. Skins changed the community. I love skins as much as the next buffalo bill, but it dropped the maturity level of community as a whole. In fact, the game itself feels like it attracted a more immature audience. Circlejerks about skins and music kits are rife and most of the real content is refined to competition threads, even if the odd skadoodle fan club has a meeting there! 
5/31/2015 5:21:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/kaedak/	GMT+5	17	I'll be taking an Intro to CS in the next 2 semesters, but at this time I have no previous experience. 	Being that I'm still getting my feel for the actual playing of CS:Go (91 competitive MM wins [GN2, I'm not the greatest I'll admit] and FACEIT with friends), I have yet to host or admin any servers. However, I did at one point in 2012-2013 own and manage a Garry's Mod server for 4 months, with the service NFOSERVERS and a variety of plugins. Prior to that, I was head-admin of a Garry's Mod server for 2 months. In terms of admining and hosting servers, that's the extent of my experience. 	Although up-votes may not reflect the importance of Community Night, from personal experience at /r/CoDCompetitive, I can sympathize with limited response to attempted community integration. I believe that the current structure of a stickied thread, community Map Tests, and 10 mans are as active as we can remain in the community without being overbearing and limiting the creative space Reddit is meant to be for posts and informative articles. That being said, complacency is failure, and without accepting community feedback and turning that into improvement, we aren't doing our job as mods. So if I were to be added to the team, I would be more than obliged to further delve into the potential pit falls of Community Night, what the mod mail feedback has been like, and what potential changes could be implemented for improvement. 	Newbie Thursday I consider to be the best feature of Global Offensive. While there are slip ups regarding the no judgement policy, but that's inevitable. All things considered, the handling of the threads has been great. It's a fantastic place to interact with people of much higher ranks if you don't have access to those kind of friends that won't flame you on your friends list. It creates a sense of community that's otherwise unattainable. I have nothing to say other than to commend you guys for this thread. 	My name is Cale; I'm from San Antonio, Texas and have resided here all 17 years of my life. I played lacrosse and football every year until this upcoming one, where I'm sticking to lacrosse and focusing on Public Forum Debate. I'm taking 3 APs, and I'm involved in Advanced Journalism (fancy speak for newspaper). I truly do believe I am qualified for this position, primarily due to my experience in the dreaded Call of Duty eSports scene.   In July of last summer, I applied to join an organization that goes by CoD_Stats (its twitter may be found here: https://twitter.com/CoD_Stats). After being accepted for the position, I worked proficiently and tirelessly at collecting data and brainstorming advanced metrics for our still (very basic) site here:, http://codcompstats.com/. In 6 months, I was in the 11 man leadership section of the organization, and I currently reply to all emails for the org and write around 20% of the tweets, in addition to basic match covering duties. A lot of the professional experience I've garnered in my time with the organization, in dealing with figureheads like MLG and Activision very directly in exchanging services and providing numbers particularly, directly transfers over into being able to handle the pressures of dealing with big names in any eSports scene, and lacks up for the potential lack of maturity that comes with my age. I'm the youngest person in that leadership group by almost 3 years, and I believe I'm more than capable of presenting myself in a way that provokes respect.   In terms of moderation experience, I've been moderating http://www.reddit.com/r/CoDCompetitive/ for the past 6 months, and while ~18,000 subs with several hundred active members on at once is minuscule compared to 200k subs and the traffic that comes along with that, I have learned a lot about the basics of moderating, the stylesheet, dealing with users, checking and responding to mod mail frequently and effectively, among other things. I've also learned to deal with sub and mod drama, if you will. I've been through and a part of the painful removal of 2 moderators, which was met with much backlash behind closed doors. It took a lot of careful action to make sure this type of drama didn't leak profusely into the sub and detract from what's important: the discussion of eSports. I am also the youngest mod on that sub by 3 years, and have not allowed this to handicap my performance. I don't know why I feel the need to take such a defensive stance on age in every interview I ever do, but I always wind up doing it. Better safe than sorry.   I've made a lot of awesome friends through these 2 professional experiences that have helped me mature not only as a contributor, but as a person. People like http://www.reddit.com/user/slopnessie I can now consider good friends of mine, who moderate multiple eSports subreddits and provide great advice in terms of handling subreddit activities. I have a framework of friends much older than me that provided the support I needed in the past couple of years to grow into the person I am today. That person I think can moderate this sub well.    Finally, I'll address the seeming lack of activity on my account as of late, and particularly on this sub, and why I believe it's not an issue. My duties in the subs I've been moderating recently and in CoD_Stats have required me to write a lot of emails, and in conjunction with finals, I lost a lot of the time I had to be a quality contributor. However, as I've been learning more and more about CS, and getting a lot more into the pro scene (I'm a big ex-dignitas/TSM fan), watching matches to improve my play and gain the context I need to truly enjoy the eSport to its fullest, I find myself on this sub a ton on a daily basis. While I haven't been writing a lot, I've been all over, learning what I believe I need to in order to become a quality contributor. So while perhaps my user overview may not reflect it, I'm on this sub a lot. While I'm not a Global Elite, or a guy that's posting Update Summaries , I think I have a unique perspective, fresh ideas, and a personality of vocality, amiability, and assertiveness that could bring a new dynamic to the mod team without being overwhelming. I've found I can mold to many different types of people in my previous work experience, and find a niche and something I can excel at. I'd love to do that here. Due to my past experience modding an eSports sub, I feel like the learning curve will not be steep or rough to handle whatsoever, and truly believe I could integrate myself seamlessly in this group, filling whatever role you guys need. If you need a vocal new perspective, I'm here. If you just need a guy that can be friendly, get along in the group, and do the dirty work sifting through comments, flairing posts, and answering mod mails, I've been doing that for the past 6 months already.   I'd like to close saying that if I were to somehow make it through the rest of the stages of this interview, I would resign from my position as moderator over at CoDCompetitive if I could not take a smaller role in order to function as an active and effective moderator over here, so time is not an issue, especially with finals wrapped up.    I'd like to thank you guys for the opportunity. Good luck in finding the best possible moderators for the team! 	4-6 months	The community of Global Offensive has sour moments just like any other, but compared to its eSports brothers, I would argue this is the least toxic 'major' eSports sub. I enjoy interaction with its members, and find the conversation to be, largely, pleasant. However, the issue of rank superiority (people being jerks to lower ranks) can get a little overwhelming at times and can be a huge factor in dissuading new members of lower ranks, particularly silver level players. I do understand this to be the nature of the community as a whole, not just the sub, and there's only so much moderation that can be done on this issue without infringing on free speech. I think pure toxicity has grounds for punishment, and having a great hold on that comes with more moderators (as you guys are going about getting now). So in summary, if I had to pick a bone with the mod team, it'd be the occasional lax nature regarding toxicity.   One aspect of the team I'd like to compliment is the balance between fun and work. From what I can see on the outside, the right amount of fluff and community driven threads (ESEA protest threads as of late, things of that nature) are allowed in, and this sub knows how to have fun. It's not overly oppressive of users who want to have their witty moments, while also being cognizant of the fact it has to facilitate a healthy community hub for the largest FPS eSport in the world. As a mod on teams that weren't ever able to find that balance, I can definitely appreciate its merit.  
5/31/2015 5:32:45	http://www.reddit.com/user/DatUrsidae/	GMT+2	19	I don't have any experience with coding.	I don't have any experience in admining CS:GO servers.	Personally I haven't been able to attend these events since they are usually timed in the middle of practice, but I think they would be a great way to get to know the community more while playing with each other. ;)	Newbie Thursdays are great way for people who might hesitate on making a topic on the subreddit with their question. It's also a good source for tips and tricks you might not end up seeing somewhere else. Personally I like reading and answering the questions whenever I am able to provide a good answer.	Heya. I come from Finland and I've been part of the community for a while now. Been playing FPS games casual / competitive since 2006 and Counter-Strike is something very different to other shooters. I put a lot of time to become better and understand what it takes to go from zero to hero, so to say.  I started checking this subreddit mostly because of wickedplayers patch note posts whenever there was a update in my game. After a while of lurking, I decided to make my first reddit account which got me into the whole reddit thing. The community really helped me whenever I had a question to post and I wanted to do the same for others. I like sharing my knowledge, which explains why I've adopted a few silvers long time ago who are no longer silvers and I am very proud of that.  I've been admin on big community servers on different games such as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and GTA:SA multiplayer mod called Multi Theft Auto. A perk that I own which I am pretty grateful of is that I can listen, in fact I love listening to other people. Whenever someone comes to me with a problem be it about a game or real life, I will listen and hear them out.  I have a lot of time in my hands now that school stuff is over and this subreddit is an amazing community which I want to help develop further in the future. Community here has given me a lot and I try to give it back.  Thanks for reading and taking your time,  Ursidae.	10-12 months	I am one of those persons who admire communities and thrives to be part them, /r/GlobalOffensive delivers just that and I love it for that.  There are a few problems with big audiences, people will pick a trend and sheep it, just as a big audience would go 'Booo' if majority does as well. People are being downvoted for their honest opinions on subjects and completely thrown off the table.  Now this happens in most subreddits this size, but there are good things also. With size this big, whenever you post a new topic, you're most likely going to get an answer within 5 to 10 minutes if not less. People will help the new players and this community has created a lot of things useful for players, such as silver adopting, coaching and bunch of guides.  Overall it's a great place to be part of.
5/31/2015 5:49:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/Oboministre/	GMT+3	15	I have some basic knowledge of java, html and looking to learn css and c#	Only exp. i've had in terms of admining are for smaller twitchers, but no reddit admining.	They are a great way to get some awesome bonds with other players, but they are a couple of hours too late for example people who have work. My personal games in map testing nights have been awesome, and i got some good friends among those people.	I haven't taken part in those, but what i've heard i think it's an awesome way for newer players to launch cs and actually enjoy it, knowing the quirks of the game. ;)	Well, my name is Otso and i live in Pori, Finland. I am 15 years old (Turning 16 on september.), with way too much time somedays! :) I have lots of interest in moderating in general, since i have time to do that, and i feel that this is a good way to also "grow" a name in the community. I've played cs since 2011, and i really started getting into csgo just before the first major. I have about 2000h in cs in total (2 accounts.) and i am a real gaming fan outside of cs too. My main interest outside of gaming is music, and i have played drums for all of my life. I've also made music, and i love writing stuff. For the next few months i have a vacation, so i have really much time, and after that a bit less, but still more than most people XD. I am generally known for being friendly outside of the game (in-game im a cannibal!) and i feel like i have enough will to help the community to actually be of use. Thanks for your time guys! Let the force of GabeN be with you! :D -oboministre	2-3 years	Before i heard of this subreddit, it was a lot harder to stay up with the metagame e.g epic smg rushes XD and the inside jokes. I'm not even lying when i say, that i can't think of that much in making this reddit community better, apart for adding more admining, and something to keep the trolls away. 
5/31/2015 6:02:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/Carlos_Menezes	GMT+1	16	I know how to work with HTML, CSS and Python. I'm not very advanced in any of those but I can work with them. I've learnt pseudocode in Mathematics class, which I believe is what you refer to "regular expressions"?	I've not been an administrator in any CS:GO server because I'm not much of a casual player, but I was once offered a position in Bwakk's surf server, which I declined.  Apart from that, I've been an administrator in several SA:MP servers, such as Next Generation Gaming and a moderator in Los Santos Roleplay (forum.ls-rp.com).	I believe it's a good way to bring the community together and have a good time!	Reddit seems to be the epicentre for many CS:GO players, and having a Newbie Thursday is a very good way to attract more players to our subreddit and reply to their questions, therefore making the game more enjoyable for them!	I'm a 16 years old (1 day to be 17 years old, yay!) guy from Portugal who enjoys playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I've been playing CS since my 9 years of age.  Right now, I study Science in Porto Santo, a little island that belongs to Portugal. I'm on my second year of studies, there's one more to go. I am hoping to take a course on Psychology or Civil Engineering. However, I do have some time to spend helping the CS:GO community, specifically this subreddit.  I'm very organized and I can easily cooperate with others, and that's what is needed in a team, in this case, the moderator team of /r/globaloffensive. 	7-9 months	In my opinion, the work behind the scenes is very good. I've not yet been involved in any problems or issues as a user of this subreddit, and that's something that makes me come back to it everytime.
5/31/2015 6:05:47	http://www.reddit.com/user/Djmaddox	GMT+1	20	I've done some HTML/CSS/Javascript a while back, it will take me a while to get properly into that again.	I have built up quite some experience moderating in Minecraft server networks. I've been an administrator & content creator for the Shotbow Network for 2,5 years, where the player count used to get up to 8000 players. I've managed communities on this network, which I always enjoyed. I now moved on to a smaller network, MineHQ. On here I still admin a server with ~300 players on. Other than the in-game servers, I also moderate the subreddits. The Shotbow/HCFactions subreddit used to be quite strict, whereas the MineHQ subreddit(/r/hcteams) was always more open in regards of what was being posted.   Other than the Minecraft servers, I run my own CS:GO server for my team to practice and scrim on. 	Enjoyable, I've participated in a few of them myself too. Very friendly people who don't care if others are having a bad day playing.	Very useful for new players, I wish it existed when I just started to play. 	I'm 20 years old and I'm from the Netherlands. I can speak Dutch, English and partial German. I've been playing FPS's for as long as I can remember but CS:GO is the one that really stuck to me. I currently work only 2-3 days each week, meaning I have a lot of free time. I wanted to expand my moderation knowledge and experience, and when I saw the request for applications I instantly knew I was going to apply. I hope I can also bring in my experience dealing with 'younger' redditors.  Here is my steam profile link if needed: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015409394/  I hope you can give me a chance to show what I'm worth. Thank you for this chance and good luck choosing the right candidates!	19-24 months	I think the community hasn't changed too much from when I first was here. In the time I've been browsing this subreddit, CS:GO and it's community expanded a lot. I've not noticed a big change in the reddit community because of this, mainly because the few toxic people that did get in here get downvoted / get their posts removed anyway. What I enjoy very much is how I can use /r/globaloffensive as my main source for CS:GO news, since posts regarding updates/roster changes get posted quickly and get a lot of upvotes too.
5/31/2015 6:10:25	http://www.reddit.com/user/mehmetti	GMT+2	20	not actually so much, but i would very much like to get to it	years ago i hosted some cod4 servers, cant remember the little details very well, but it wasnt anything too complicated, pretty much anyone with even a little motivation could do it	havent participated but looks like a fun thing	i like the concept very much, since community is more or less offensive on the lower skilled side	well well, im a 20yo guy from finland, currently in school to become an electrician and i enjoy to read through reddit and play cs whenever i have time to do so. i think im pretty calm and laid back type of person, not getting provoked easily and can take criticism for my actions. also as stated above, im not so familiar with coding, but for awhile ive wanted to get to it, so if its somehow possible, i would be very grateful for it. i've also applied for LoL reddit mod, but at that time, i didnt have required time spent on that subreddit(which was 1 year at least with proof). and for the ending, im more of a "spectator" in reddit, i dont really comment so much, but i would like to interact more with the community and i feel like this would be my kind of thing.	10-12 months	i like this community more than what i remember of League of Legends community, obviously there are some trolls and people who enjoy "roughing" others, but overall i think there are alot of people who help and give advice to someone who is asking for it. and for the mods part, i havent seen anything done from you that would make me "gringe" so i could say u have been doing good work
5/31/2015 6:14:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/ThatLatvianAsshole/	UTC+3	18	No	No	I think it's a good way to bring the community together, find some new friends maybe, not my type of thing though.	I think it's extremely helpful for players of any skill level, I often participate in it by asking something or answering some questions because I really like it.	I'm a high school student, just finished 11th grade, have a ton of free time, so I browse reddit and /r/globaloffensive especially a lot. I'm not really social IRL, so all of my time is spent playing video games, browsing reddit and watching streams, which is why I think I could be a good moderator. I understand that being a moderator is not just a fun little thing and will take it extremely seriously. I've been playing CS for almost a year now, currently LE, I am fairly passionate about the game and the professional scene, and hope to someday be able to play at semipro or pro level. If you look at my comment history then you might find some things that would be less than ideal for a moderator to say, but if I actually get accepted then I will definitely change that and start thinking twice before commenting. What I could bring to the table is removing posts breaking the rules, helping community members, participating in mod discussions and bringing my hopefully objective, unbiased opinion, as well as doing any other required moderator responsibility that may come up (besides any kind of coding). - Bruno (ThatLatvianAsshole)	10-12 months	I like some parts of it, but to be honest, I don't like a lot of it. There are a ton people insulting each other, downvoting each other for no reason and circlejerking over things.
5/31/2015 6:26:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/Darmothy/	GMT+1	20	No	Not in CS:GO.  I did some admining of servers in the game America's Army 2. It was for a clan who had some servers with special game modes. I also did some modding on some small TeamSpeak servers.	I never really participated in them becouse of time zones but I think it is a really nice idea to host community events. With so many subscribers to the subreddit there will always be interest in it and people might want to enjoy this game in other ways than just 100% MM.	I think it's great. I frequently browse the threads and try to give answers to unanswered questions. Sometimes I even ask a question myself and it's really nice to finally get an answer on some subjects becouse most of the time someone will be able to answer it.	I am a 20 year old student from the Netherlands with a passion for gaming and CS:GO (and a lot of free time). My favourite teams are mousesports and Hellraisers.  I have been playing games since I was very young and never stopped doing it. When playing games I always liked to join game specific forums and participate in the community of that game. I started using reddit around the same time as I started playing CS:GO. Around 3 years ago.  When I started to play CS more and more i discovered this subreddit and it was of course different than a normal forum. It was easy to find, had lots of users and lots of content. The only downside for me was that it was non-personal. You don't really recognise to many people.   I have since played more than 2500 hours of CS:GO and I don't see that changing any time soon. I am active in other CS related subs too such as /r/globaloffensivetrade, /r/csgobetting and /r/csgomarketforum. I like to follow the professional scene too.   I might not be the most active poster but I still spent a lot of time in these subreddits. Voting, reporting, commenting and overal just enjoying my time spent. I would love to pick up the task of helping this subreddit and the community while moderating it.	19-24 months	I like the community otherwise I would have left a long time ago. Ofcouorse with so many subscirbers there will be trolls and there will be posts that I really don't like but it's not that big of a problem for me. One thing I would love if there can be some more serious discussions and a bit less fluff.
5/31/2015 6:50:36	http://reddit.com/user/LordCake	GMT+2	21	I have very basic knowledge of HTML and PHP, having dabbled in those languages in the past. I'm studying Computing next year though, so hopefully I can expand my arsenal.	I have a lot of experience administrating community servers in Counter Strike: Source. Community servers were obviously far more prominent back in Source as there were no Official Valve servers of any kind.   I was a highly ranked Admin in the community I was in for ~3 years, administrating all types of servers including ZM, ZE, Prison Break, DR, Mini Games & Surf.  I also ran my own servers at one point, but they were very temporary and were hosted on Windows, I believe Linux was the superior server hosting OS.	I have yet to participate in any, but they are definitely a good idea. A chance to bring the community together through a passion they all share and test out some new maps in the process. Brilliant. 	I'm afraid I am not familiar with Newbie Thursday.	My name is Christopher, I am 21 and I currently live in Germany. I will be studying Computing in Edinburgh next year (next academic year).  Not only do I have experience administrating CS community servers but I also have notable experience moderating popular gaming subreddits, namely /r/DayZ.  I've been a moderator at /r/DayZ for 2.5+ years now. I've seen and experienced many things on our subreddit, from disappointment in the game (a topic you may be able to relate to on this subreddit), to popular youtubers who play DayZ being accused of cheating, to Developer hate that is almost never reasonable and constructive. I've learned a lot moderating /r/DayZ and as I find myself playing more CSGO and spending more time on your subreddit, I want to be able to use my time on the subreddit more effectively, by means of moderating.  Although I don't comment that often, I am extremely active on this subreddit. I would argue that I am picking up my slack as far as commenting is concerned, because I am a lurker at heart but I am enjoying sharing my thoughts with the community more and more.  Essentially, I enjoy browsing and sometimes commenting in this subreddit, I also enjoy moderating and thus would like to combine my interests and be more effective with my time spent here. 	13-18 months	I like the community, as far as I have seen most people are kind and friendly with each other, even in the face of differing opinions. I have seen many subreddits, both smaller and greater in size that have far more hostile environments in the comments.   The only thing I don't quite like is when there are waves of people linking to their workshop submissions fishing for workshop "upvotes". However, these waves tend to come and go and obviously don't diminish my redditing experience.
5/31/2015 6:58:09	http://www.reddit.com/user/lampa_cz/	GMT+2	16	I know basic HTML and C. 	I set up few CS:S/CS:GO servers for my friends community. All of them hosted on Linux VPS.	I never took part in one.	I try to read every single one, it's great for people with not much experience. Even though i never asked anything i always discover something new that i didnt know of.	Hmmm... i have never been good in wiring walls of text but i guess i will try. As i stated before im *just* 16 years old student from Czech Republic (Currently studying Programming/Computer Engineering) who loves FPS shooters. I played bit of 1.6 when i was younger (wasnt long time ago :P) and CS:S. I'm think very active redditor since i have nothing to do all day other than play or browse reddit so i though, why not try to apply for a mod? 	4-6 months	People say it toxic but i dont think its that bad... there are trolls but thats to be expected. Its Internet after all. I also definitely love this subreddit design. I know its been a while since you change it but i loved the Katowice theme and user created banners.
5/31/2015 7:02:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/happyoccasion/	UTC+1	27	HTML, CSS, java & C#. Capable of learning. :)	no.	I have not participated for more than once or twice. I think it's great but I don't have enough experience to make any suggestions or elaborate much further. 	Great way to trickle down knowledge. 	I'm 28 in two weeks. Will graduate from university tomorrow (1st june) after 10 years of studies (philosophy, aesthetics, filmmaking) most recently informatics.  I live in Malmö in southern Sweden together with my girlfriend. We follow the pro scene together, with her favorite team being NiP and favorite player being NBK. I like Na'Vi. I strated playing counter-strike at beta 5.2 many years ago. I have never been a star or particularly good player. I simply enjoyed the game, setting up local servers at our school playing during recess. My first experience with GO happened last summer and well. I spend too much time reading your subreddit, playing or watching games.   Apart from CS I like to watch movies, especially swedish silent era cinema, french art nouvelle, and late era soviet cinema.   Oh, also I'm a total history-lover. Right now I'm studying romani peoples life in sweden in the 40s-50s. I think I'm one of few who have an interest in history but none whatsoever in the second world war.   Anyways,  Thanks for a great subreddit	7-9 months	Well, there are several communities at /r/globaloffensive. One of the problems would be the high degree of polarization between these in particular questions.   I'm really sick of hearing about Moe.  Your work with forms and development of the subreddit is really impressive though and I feel as it is less toxic today than only two months ago.  
5/31/2015 7:08:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/treav0r/	UTC+2	20	Some basic Java, HTML, CSS and PHP skills.	I did host some Teamspeak Servers, but nothing CS:GO related.	It is a good idea to playtest some awesome new maps.	I like it, nothing to complain or improve comes to my mind.	20y/o student from Germany, polite and friendly and up to challenge something new every day.	19-24 months	Allways good for great fun, but it can get out of hand pretty quickly (Fnatic boost drama)

I could be good addition to this subreddit - ambassador of democracy in nazi moderation. I can write reddit bots, help with html/css. This is my second or third applicaiton so I'm quite certain I'll not get moderator on /r/globaloffensive but at least I tried.	13-18 months	too much downvotes based on opinion, there should be visible FAQ with repetitive questions like  * "whats your sensitivity, mouse, etc." * "how XP level works" (this is new but expect /new to be flooded by posts like this) * "i got kicked and got cooldown" * "bad bad russians" * ...  also there should be something like "xxx MEGA-THREAD" in case of some big events - like new operation bloodhound  you guys could copy lot of ideas from /r/pcmasterrace which in my opinion is perfect subreddit  user who wrote post removed by mods should be notified otherwise its just censorship. people are not aware you are removing posts
5/31/2015 7:11:38	http://reddit.com/u/facie97	GMT+1	18	I have experience in php, python, c#, tiny bit c++ and a bit of NodeJs.  I DO know html/css/javascript but styling and visuals is just not my thing.	I've hosted a small private server just to mess around with my team and know basic commands, but other than that, not really.	I've sadly never participated (i guess I thought I was not good enough), but it's a great idea. I think its great to interact with the community and just make them feel acknowledged and welcome.	Its good to help new people in their process to become a new fnatic member.	Well I'm 18 years old and from the Netherlands. My hobbies are mostly programming and gaming (csgo obviously), but I'm also pretty social and i like to go out and get wasted.  For me, a counter-strike match is all about fun, as long as its not giving away free wins ofcourse. I'm still Gold Nova Master though :(	7-9 months	The community has brought me a nice load of joy and fun, but also gives good constructive critisism when needed.
5/31/2015 7:18:28	https://www.reddit.com/user/choppedeuce/	UTC-7	17	Yes, I have a very good basis of HTML and CSS as I am a college student studying computer science. I have taken a Web Design Class and an Intro to Programming class so I do have coding experience.	I almost always host servers for my real life friends and steam friends to play on, frequently having 10-15 people playing different games at once. Although I have hosted csgo 5v5s before, I mostly host for other games like Minecraft, Space Engineers, Terraria and Civ 5 games. Never had any problems with people.	I have played on the community nights a few times, I honestly do not play it a lot because I am a higher rank that those who typically participate and it feels like I am ruining the game for others, especially those around nova level.	I absolutely love Newbie Thursday and it is one of my favorite rI think Newbie Thursday is a great way for old and new players alike to asks questions that have already been answered or for questions that really do not deserve their own thread. Love it and always read through and learn something new every week.	Hi, my name is Nick and I am a 17 year old high school student participating in a  program that lets me go to the local community college instead of high school. I have a passion for computers and am currently on track to graduate with a general associates in science before I graduate high school and then move onto a 4 year college to pursue my love for software engineering. I have already taken a few basic classes like Web Design and Intro. I love gaming, especially with my close friends both real life and steam friends. I have browsed the Global Offensive Reddit for a good while, but rarely post and the one I generally use I lost access to and haven't been able to recover. I really love the competition of CS:GO and believe that a close game with good teams is much better than a blowout win. I am currently ranked Supreme Master First Class up from Nova 4 when I started playing csgo (when matchmaking first started). Although I am mostly a lurker, I definitely have a lot to offer for the CS:GO community because of my absolute passion for the game. Thanks for reading all this and have a good day!	2-3 years	I like the csgo reddit community a whole lot, especially those who break down the game and give numbers because I love that kind of stuff. Although I'm not a lover of "fluff" posts, I usually take a look at them because some of them are genuinely entertaining. The mods seems to do a good job overall, but are much too lenient when it comes to people posting their skins looking for upvotes and people with "my friend made me a knife irl" posts contribute little to the community. I have lurked the community for about 2.5 years and lost access to my old Reddit account I used, but love seeing how huge the community has grown. I'm still surprised seeing posts with over 1000 upvotes when, even just a few months ago the best posts were getting 400. I really enjoy visiting the Global Offensive community and is a really great way for me to engage CS:GO in many different ways besides just playing it. A strong community that is growing at an extremely fast rate is very good for the game and good for the community.

I have a B in Computing Science at National 5 level and I am awaiting results on my Higher level (Scottish Qualifications) 		I have personally not taken part in any community nights but I think it is a great idea and I am definitely planning on taking part in the future.	I think newbie Thursday is fantastic, It allows players of all skill levels to ask questions and any player of any skill levels that may know the question to answer it, I have used it a few times and usually find myself reading most of the thread.	I am 16, Male and I am from Scotland, UK. I've been playing CS for around 2 years and surfing /r/GlobalOffensive for around a year. I Fly Fish for the youth Scotland squad and so I have very good communication and team working skills, I have no problem expressing my opinion on a matter but I will always listen to the opposite opinion. I am currently finished school and don't start back until the 31st August when I am starting college and Will be busy 4 days a week from 9AM until 4AM. Until this point I am pretty much free all day except from a Saturday Or Sunday once every couple of weeks. I regularly browse through the new section and it can be sort of frustrating to see a post that I know is against the rules or is breaking rules somewhere in the thread and not be able to do anything about it.  I have TeamSpeak3 and Skype, I am available to talk until around 11pm. Can't wake up the parents or the WiFi goes off! I need my own place don't I?  Thanks for reviewing my application and good luck finding a Moderator.   	10-12 months	I think /r/GlobalOffensive has great potential. The community are not afraid to express their feelings on current issues or to debate and express opinions. I think many people would agree that overall /r/GlobalOffensive is a very mature community, although there are a few bad apples but that can't be helped.
5/31/2015 7:42:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/amuststache/	GMT+3	17	I used to run gaming blogs so I am experienced in HTML and CSS.	I used to be partnered with a CS 1.6 server rental website, that's the only experience I got.	I think it's a great way to interact with the community. In some threads people are complaining about how most of the MM community is toxic and they need friends. I genuinely think most people need mini-events like this to keep in touch with the community.	I think it's a great way of helping out new players without spamming the subreddit with questions.	I live in Turkey and I am 17 years old. I'm struggling with a lot of health problems that's why I spend most of my time on PC. My MM rank is Legendary Eagle. I believe that I have good knowledge of the game, and I know how to stay in touch with the community.	7-9 months	I find the community to be entertaining and friendly. I love how higher ranked players are seeking to help out new players instead of making fun of them. Believe it or not, this doesn't happen in most other games.
5/31/2015 7:43:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/PowerTattie/	GMT+1	22	Basic HTML and java. I'm an engineering student so most of my coding experience is in C and microC.		Although I don't participate in them myself, they seem great. The method is very similar to how we used to set up pugs in Tribes Ascend. Players would connect to mumble and sit in the channel corresponding to the role they wished to play. 2 Team captains would then pick players and the match would begin. To ensure everyone got to play, there was a channel for "Just played or Just joined" which was separate from the roles. Players who were in this channel could not be picked until the roles channels were empty. We also had a channel for new players, anyone in this channel had priority and would always get picked first.   As I said, I have not participated in the community nights myself, but do intend to. I think a few things could be learned from the tribes community in the way pugs were managed, to ensure a fair and fun night for everyone.  	A fantastic resource that in my opinion is essential to aid newer players. 	As previously mentioned, i'm a 22 year old Engineering Student living in Edinburgh, Scotland with my longtime girlfriend. I started playing csgo in closed beta after receiving a key, but didn't enjoy it. (I think many will agree the game is far better now). I returned around the arms deal update, and have been playing in some form ever since.   I moderate reddit.com/r/tribes and have been playing Tribes Ascend since early 2012, both casually and competitively. The tribes community know me as a very friendly and approachable person, as well as for basic "Capping Route" videos I used to make early on in the game.    Good luck with your search for a new moderator.	19-24 months	Obviously with the growth of CSGO the bad apples tend to stick out more. This could be attributed to betting, but feels to me like the community has a lower average age than in beta. This is obviously not a problem, but does mean that moderators need to keep a closer eye on things. In my opinion, younger people tend to be a bit more outspoken and often will make a comment purely to get a reaction. At least, this has been the case in the sub-reddit I moderate, which is /r/tribes. 
5/31/2015 7:49:39	http://www.reddit.com/user/razrrr	UTC+1	22	Yes, I do have experience in Java as I'm currently in my third semester for my Bachelor of Science degree in business informatics. I'm probably not able to code big things, but I'm definitely familiar with it and able to do some stuff. I also know the basics of HTML, but I guess that's not too hard.	In my past I administrated a lot of servers. As I come from the CoD2 community I have my roots there. Actually I don't feel it was that hard to configure CoD2 servers, but I was the only one able to do so in my team. So in CoD2 I even knew how to create a server on a root server. Something I wasn't able to do in CS:GO yet. I've had some private servers, but they were all hosted by companies, so basically all that was to do were to know the admin commands. In the past two months I was one of the three admins on a fun/aim map server. The server had about 5000 players registered and was hosted by nitrado.net with 24 slots. Unfortunately the server went down after the host tried to run the server on his root server and disappeared shortly after. So to make a long story short: I do have experience in admining servers.	Actually I do like the idea, but I have never participated in any of the Community Nights, simply because I don't like Mumble. I know probably most of the North Americans prefer Mumble over Teamspeak, but personally I just hate Mumble, so if you would offer Teamspeak communication, that would be great.	I do like Newbie Thursday a lot! It's actually the only place where people can ask questions and not get flamed or laughed about. It also prevents useless topics as people know there's a place where they can ask all their questions and don't need to open a new thread.	My name is Dominik Hünitzsch, I'm 22 years old and I'm playing CS:GO since the BETA, with a few breaks. I currently live in Hanover, Germany, and as already mentioned above I'm studying business informatics. In my free time I like to play tennis and I cheer for Hannover 96 and Bayern Munich. I would say I'm pretty much soccer/football addicted. I really like to help people and I know that the position as /r/GlobalOffensive MOD comes with a lot of responsibility. As I was a CoD2 player for many years, I had a lot to do with ClanBase, where I also was a Cheat & Abuse Assistant for several years, which means I was responsible for banning/unbanning players. At that time ClanBase had over 500,000 people registered. At the time I made the switch to CS:GO I was a Journalist for Fnatic and followed their first steps from 1.6 to CS:GO, when they still had players like FYRR73 and rytter under contract. I guess it was a rocky road for them :-) Overall I would say I'm a person who gets a long with almost everyone and I just like to get to know many new people around the world and that's why I also love Counter-Strike.	10-12 months	In my opinion it's the best "part" of the community or where the best part of the community gathers. HLTV.org is just a place for trolls and there are just way too many people who like to pick a fight. Of course there are also people like that on /r/GlobalOffensive, but you will never have only the "good" people. It's a good mix. When I started using the subreddit frequently it was more of a place where people ask their questions about the game and a lot of videos were posted if I remember correctly. Over the time the subreddit developed more into a place where you can have conversations and get information pretty quick, which I think is great. I also like the sticky posts when there are big tournaments, because they pretty much sum up every information you need re the tournament. On the other hand there's always one "thing" that gets hyped and then the subreddit gets flooded with that content, which can be very annoying. At the moment it's these "mow downs" where people post their gifs where they eliminate the entire team with their P90 or whatever. In my oppinion that's very annoying and I just don't like seeing the same content over and over again. It's pretty much the only thing I can complain about at the moment.

It's nice seeing the community helping the new ones, i think it's great.	I'm 16 yo male from Israel. i love sports (mainly soccer and basketball), programming, gaming and computers in general. That's me basically; i'm not the wordy type of guy.	10-12 months	I love it.
5/31/2015 9:01:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/wilcore89	GMT+2	26	I know the basics of HTML and Java.		It's always fun to play with people from a certain forum/community. you can get new friends if you are lucky and you can share inside jokes that other people wouldn't get. I haven't played community night with r/global but I used to play a shit-ton of action quake 2 and TFC with a small scandinavian forum (roughly 10 years ago).   		I work as a graphical designer. I'm a 26 year old swede. I spend a lot of the time in front of a computer both at work and at home- partially because of my disability( I have mild cerebral Palsy and scoliosis).. Hobbies include: video games, board games, movies, documentaries, swimming.	10-12 months	I think it's the right mix of serious discussion and humour(without being too juvenile). sometimes one might that the discussion is way too negative but thats just because most people wouldn't turn to a forum or subreddit when they are completely happy with a game.  Its a great sub! 
5/31/2015 8:05:08	http://www.reddit.com/user/Trombley7/	GMT+1	19	No.	No.	Great concept. Unfortunately I have not been able to take part in the event itself. The community is big and there's not room for everyone. 	It's one of the best parts of the community. CSGO is growing rapidly and these kinds of "help threads" are vital for both making the new users more familiar with the game (and not driven away because of the steep learning curve) but also for reduce the amount of posts asking for how to control the ak spray pattern etc. and the mods can instead work on how to make the sub better for users rather than keeping it at a normal level.	I'm Oscar, 19 years old. I started playing CSGO right after the beta ended with really no prior experience to Counter Strike than playing 1.6 casually with friends. I took to the game slowly at first, since the hard learning curve, but through youtube videos, forum posts (/r/globaloffensive mainly) I started to get better. Today I'm at DMG in MM and I can only see myself improving. This is the charming thing with CSGO. It makes me want to improve so bad, even though I scream and curse at my screen from time to time.   Apart from my love to CS, I also am a vivid reddit user. Not many days go without me going there (weather it's on PC or on my phone) and I always browse around on /r/globaloffensive when on reddit. Other interests I have are computer hardware. I love putting together computers and making them look appealing. I also love reading. The one series I, figuratively, burn for is A Song of Ice And Fire, more commonly referenced as Game of Thrones. I have an extended collection of books and other items based on the show. I'm also a member of the moderation team over at /r/gameofthrones, which is currently just short of 519k subscribers, so moderation experience is not an issue.  Also. Cats are the best. http://i.imgur.com/MeqX9YY.jpg	19-24 months	I subscribed when the sub was around 20k (I believe) strong and what strikes me the most is, obviously, the huge growth in users. Even though it's wonderful to have such a large community around this fantastic game, it has it's bad sides. The amount of people not really caring for the game and just being there for harassing and making the community look, over all, bad, is expanding as well. The problem with this is not only that it sucks being called slurs and being told that you suck, etc, but it damages the image of the counter strike scene in general. If esports are going to be taken seriously, the image of us and the game being these angry, hateful kids need to go away. 
5/31/2015 8:12:46	http://reddit.com/u/DylanBoss	UTC+1	16	I'm familiar with CSS, since I've been helping /r/Steam (a subreddit where I'm a moderator) customize /r/Naut.	I've hosted a Minecraft server for 2 years, after that I hosted a CS:GO surf server.	It's a great idea. 	Again, a great idea. 	Like I said, I'm a 16 year old student from Belgium studying IT. Currently learning C++ online because I don't have that option in my school. I'm also a moderator on /r/Steam. Since I'm a student in a technology course (not sure if this is the right word to use...) I have ~14 hours where I'm using a computer. This means that (along with the hours where I'm at home), I moderate the subreddit for ~14 hours. I've been doing this for a couple of months on /r/Steam now. 	13-18 months	/r/CSGO has a nice community, as long as nothing serious is happening. Let's take ESEA as an example. Right after they released their intrusive client update there were a lot of threads complaining about how bad ESEA was, how we should all go to CEVO/FaceIt and that we should boycott ESEA. The discussions got heated and there were lots of swear words being thrown around. The moderators handled this pretty well, removing most of the serious threats.
5/31/2015 8:17:11	http://www.reddit.com/user/Waffles2g	UTC+0	20	Yes, I am currently doing a forensic computing degree and therefore have some coding experience in HTML and CSS, Python, PHP, C, C# and C++. HTML and CSS I used together to create website and web based mobile applications, Python mainly for networking and basic scripts, and C, C# and C++ for specific university projects therefore i know the basics of these languages and C++ to a better level.	I was an admin on a minecraft server about 4 years ago back when minecraft was more simplistic :p	Community night is a fun was to get the community more involved in the sub reddit and have players communicate better and learn from each other! I have just recently seen community night and will be attending this week!	Newbie Thursday is a good way to avoid having hundreds of threads with simple one line answers and also gives the new members a non-threatening environment to ask their questions.	Forensic Computing 2nd year univeristy student in England, just about to enter my third year. As I am sure you know most uni students have an abundance of time on their hands and I am no different I spend most of that playing CS:GO whether it be competitive or surfing you can tell by my 1200+ hours on my account (http://steamcommunity.com/id/unclewaffles/), and I am currently ranked MGE.  I am currently in a long term relationship coming up on two years now with a girl at my university although this does take up a large amount of my time I am lucky enough to land a girl who not only understands the enjoyment of playing games she also plays herself!!   Between gaming, university and my relationship, I spend a lot of time at the gym, I am an avid power lifter and spend at least 90 minutes a day at the gym, I got into power lifting when I first started university and I have linearly progressed since then and am looking forward to competing!  On a final note, thank you for taking the time to read my application, I hope you read all the way to here, best of luck picking some new moderators and I hope I may be one of them.	13-18 months	I enjoy casually browsing the sub-reddit as by now i'm sure you can tell I do not post much, however I do see the majority of the content on the sub-reddit. The community on this sub-reddit is miles better than the community in game much more respectful and kind however that may just be thanks to the mods deleting inappropriate posts. However there are many posts that still arise that I am not particularly fond of such as the current post on the first page of the sub-reddit "why do people like phantoml0rd?" I understand why people like talking about this sort of thing however I personally do not approve and prefer looking at quality content.
5/31/2015 8:18:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/ca1ek/	GMT+1	15	I can make stuff in Python and PHP but it's not really good, most of the time I make what I need and leave it unpolished as long as it works.	I ran a quite successful Minecraft server, with 20 slots, it was full almost all time during daytime. 			Main trait of me is that I don't like talking about myself ;p.  I have been really active member of all communities I was participating in. I really like discussing with people about stuff I like. I'm not very interested in being competitive, for me games are more of a tool to meet new people and relax, not something I play 6 hours a day with only target of becoming the best. I also like helping people, even if it gives no real gain to me.  P.S Why is there an option for 5 years of participating on the subreddit if it only exists for 3?	10-12 months	Too much fluff, not enough discussion. And when there is discussion it's just hitboxes/scout jumping/tec-9, nothing new. I think that bugs should get a megathread, with the exception of newly found ones.
5/31/2015 8:19:22	http://www.reddit.com/user/SnapCS/	GMT-7	17	I took Java in school, and had a really hard time learning it.	I used to admin Minecraft Servers, I learned the commands and expressions, then I stopped playing.	I think it's a great idea, but I don't usually play in it. I find myself always doing something else when It's scheduled.	It's a great way for new players to learn things. It's just like when we Adopt Silvers to teach them.	I started playing Counter-Strike almost two years ago and started at the rank of silver 4. I used reddit and youtube to get tips and tricks to get better, and I obtained Global Elite a month ago. I recently deleted my old reddit account to make a new one because I changed my Alias. I have 3107 hours in Counter-Strike as of May 31st, 2015. I love this game and only want to see more people get better at it. My sleeping schedule is messed up for my timezone, so I'm usually awake at night time and I browse reddit and play then. English is my first language but I speak German as well. I turn 18 on June 15th.	19-24 months	Uhm, There are two sides to the GlobalOffensive reddit. The people who want to learn, expand, and help the game get better, and the others that want to troll, learn dirty tricks, and be rude. The mods do a pretty good job at clearing those people out. The automod kinda pushes my buttons. I try adding a good title to some posts and it says I posted in the wrong subreddit. 
5/31/2015 8:22:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/shirohou-ou/	GMT+10	17	I have knowledge in:  python - had an intermediate knowledge of the language visual basic - working on projects in this at the moment c - just know how to code basic programs in c				Hi, I am Tim from Australia. I have been playing csgo since about this time last year. I follow the professional scene a little bit. I like to keep up with what is happening in the professional scene, though I often don't catch the scores of the games. I am currently in my final year of highschool, I have studied visual basic, python and c out of self interest and for school. I tend to lurk on the subreddit :(, since I don't really like to post, but I am trying to change that to be as helpful as I can. 	13-18 months	
5/31/2015 8:23:47	http://reddit.com/u/styuR	UTC+1	22	HTML, PHP, JS, CSS, SQL	Used to run a community, have my own server based in Europe just now that gets used for pugs and kz maps.	Pretty active member of them, thoroughly enjoy them.	No real thoughts.	Nothing really to say, just finished university and live in Scotland. Have played the CS series for about 8 years now but it certainly isn't my life as I have a girlfriend and somewhat of a small social life but overall, I'm a pretty boring person.	19-24 months	Eh, it's OK, a bit of a circle jerk but a lot less prone to hatred due to ranks etc than other websites. More actual CS discussion would be nice.
6/1/2015 6:47:17	http://reddit.com/u/morimo	GMT+1	18	I'm learning C++ at the moment (I'll be going to university to study Computer Science in October), I will be learning CSS PHP and HTML in June.	Not yet.	Community night is probably my favorite thing about /r/GlobalOffensive.  Comm night is great for several reasons:  1) The atmosphere is friendly. And not just in comparison to matchmaking either. All the people I played with (even when I was a silver scrub) were encouraging, positive and gave advice. Even the shittalking was good natured. I think this is partially because of the community and partially because the moderators keep the peace.  2) No cheaters (okay well I did meet one, but he's not coming back).  3) No smurfs  4) Everyone has a mic and speaks english  The admins have always been professional and reasonable in my experience (vizo and Jpon9 are the ones I've seen around and interacted with the most, so props to them).  Improvements to Comm Night that I'd like to see are mainly different gamemodes (in particular I'd really like to play scoutzknivez at Comm Night sometime).  	Newbie Thursday was helpful for me when I was new.  I think it could be improved if they could be organized in some way or if there were a table where links could automatically be added so that it is possible to look back at the previous threads.	I'm an 18 year old German guy that really enjoys Counter Strike.  I just finished my exams for senior year (12th grade) and have a bit of free time on my hands and thought it would be great to be able to contribute to the /r/GlobalOffensive community seeing as I've learned a great deal from the sub.  I have a decent amount of moderating experience outside of reddit, having been a moderator of a number minecraft servers and forums back when I was into minecraft (most notably Hypixel, which had around 50,000 forum members at that time and is now at 200,000). My experience with Hypixel means I am used to dealing with long modqueues.  I also coached a few low ranked players (some were IRL friends and others were randoms I met on the /r/GlobalOffensive sub). That took patience, but it was rewarding to see them climb ranks/get better.  Outside of CS and other games (dota2, Lethal League), I play basketball and swim (not competitively anymore though).  I am also a huge fan of Game of Thrones.  I'll be studying Computer Science this fall (but that won't be enough to kick my Counter Strike habit for better or worse).  I speak English and German fluently and can speak Spanish at a conversational level.  Thanks for reading my application!	7-9 months	The community is generally helpful and dedicated to getting better, there are still a few trolls here and there though.  The mod team has always been friendly and professional, no complaints there.
5/31/2015 8:45:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/leblarh	GMT+1	21	I know a bit of HMTL, CSS, Python, Java. I'm most comfortably in C or C#.	I assume it's servers for in-game play and not websites related to CS. I have set up my own TF2 server without help from any provider, I also maintained he server for a longer period of time.	Any form for social activity in a social group is a plus in my book, I think they should be hosted as long as people participate and show support.	It's a great way to get the new players engaged in the community and it gives them a chance to ask questions that might seem embarrasing to ask in a normal conext.	My name is Jesper. As the survey states, i'm 21 years of age, and i study computer science in Denmark. I like to play competetive games, i started with competetive TF2 but where i have been competing for 2 or 3 years. In those years I have managed to create and adminstrate my own team of nine player (highlander mode). I migrated to CS in september of 2014 because i found that the community was richer and had a way better competetive scene. I still have ties to TF2 since many of the friendships i created while play TF2 is still holding to this day, but i'm also making new ones in CS.  I hope you have a wonderful day/evening, and hope to hear from you :)  -Leblarh	7-9 months	Normally it's a great community, but sometimes people like to witch hunt, or in general be passionate about their opinions, for example the boost on overpass during DHW, as a Fnatic fan i could see how it violated the rules, but Fnatic didn't deserve all the hate they got during the following days.
5/31/2015 8:53:48	http://www.reddit.com/user/dellortCOC	UTC+0	14	A reasonable amount in Visual Basic, and moderately complex JS, along with the absolute basics of HTML and CSS	I do not, alas. While I do host a Minecraft server for friends, that hardly seems relevant.	To be honest, it doesn't really interest me. I wouldn't hang around, as I prefer more to enjoy the game as opposed to the players. I feel any input I would otherwise have is rather invalidated by that point.	This. I love this idea. Like a community driven Matchmaking Academy. I feel the knowledgeable members of the community can help the silvers and novas to improve, and in doing so broadens the spectrum of abilities that the subreddit appeals to.  I would happily help with any necessary steps to implement this, as I feel it will again batter any hate for noobs into the ground, and maybe even reduce the ranks of said silvers. I do question Thursday though. No real reason. Just... Thursday... Why...	British kid currently in Year 9 with a passion for English, Maths, Science, IT, and Drama of all things. Socially awkward, and bullied until I built up my small friend group. They've been fantastic, and that is pretty much my academic life in 50 words.  At home I spend a large time playing Minecraft or CSGO with my buddies, and occasionally popping about to do some programming for a time. On the computer far too long for my good health, or so I'm told by everyone ever dammit.  Oh, and one more thing. I hate tomatoes. Fuck them. At least with olives you can pick them out and throw them at your brother. But with tomatoes you're stuck there D: and then all the terrible juice leaks into your sandwich and you end up with the most miserable looking slab of bread ever :( Asshole fruit-veg	4-6 months	/r/GlobalOffensive has definitely been improving over the few months I've been here. Hell, I lurked about 6-7 months ago but was repelled by the rather angry niche community that seemed to have developed. Posts were all along the lines of "MM is broken, this needs fix" and while on its own it was at the time a logical point, I think everyone hopped on bandwagons a bit early.   These days, I feel we are quite a friendly and welcoming community. With the recent "Just [player] peeking [player] with a [weapon]" and funny posts going off like the boosting chickens without being down-voted to shit and /r/subredditdrama leaping in on the action, I feel as if anyone new here will see CS for what it should be in my opinion; A game. A silly one at that.   Posts are now constructive criticism to Valve, and logical discussions are due when reasonable posts are dominating the front pages. No more angry berations causing yet more circlejerking in the comment section. I  hope we are finally set to improve. 
5/31/2015 9:08:52	http://www.reddit.com/user/Lookslikeyoureeit/	GMT+2	15	I have around 3 years of experience in coding in HTML, a little bit less in CSS.	I have experience in admining pub's in CS 1.6, way before I bought any of the games.	Testing other maps, while getting to meet new people and people who are new to the community, or in the community for much longer is a great thing both in theory and in practice.	One of my favorite things on the subreddit, I never ask any questions because I'm pretty shy as a person but sometimes I love to read through the questions the community has asked, and usually get answers for my own questions in there.	I usually don't like talking about myself a lot, because I believe the point of websites like reddit is to stay anonymous. I will tell you something about myself though, but i'm hoping you won't compromise any of the information I told you. When I first decided to try out for mod I was scared, mostly because I'm younger then most of this community, and I don't usually like to giveaway that information as I feel age is not important when deciding if someone is mature enough for something, but since I know the mod's from here I'm hoping they look past my age and read something about me. I've been in love with computers my entire life, my dad taught me a fair bit of how to do HTML and coding, I kinda stopped doing that stuff for a while so I might not be that experienced. I'm not an experienced mod and every subreddit I tried to create was a fail, because I'm an extremely lazy person, which is probably the only problem you'll see with me as a mod (If you accept me of course) I've played Counter Strike since I was around 6 or 7, because one of my friends introduced it to me. I've stopped playing for a year or something before I bought CSGO, and really got hooked on the community. I've been a user of reddit for a while and thought I would enjoy posting some funny, but in my fashion lazy posts. I've only posted one thing that got some traffic so far. So the reason I'm running for a mod is because i'll like to experience the whole reddit community in another way, and from another point of view. This time i'll have a lot more reasons to actually browse through comments and see what people have to say about the posts, while deleting the inapropriate and rule breaking rules. In real life I'm a really shy person and I've been diagnosed with autism, which I've been working really hard to overcome.  By my IQ I would be considered a genius, but I consider my self a completely normal person. In my free time, when i'm not gaming or browsing the internet, I like to create music. I can send you some of the stuff I'm currently working on, but I'd feel it doesn't bring anything to the table. I'm also practicing on acting, even though I have no where to work as an actor, I still think it's fun, and It might give me an advantage later in life, I'm also a talented actor, even without practicing it. If I had a dream job though, I'd like to be a designer, or even a map creator in CSGO, because me and my friend are currently working on fully redesigning de_chateau's layout to fit competitive play, and redesigning it's textures to fit CSGO, and we plan to release it for the next operation, which hopefully comes out in around 6 months or so. Currently I'm living in Serbia, in a poor family with my dad and my grandma, in small apartment. I haven't seen my mother for more then two years, and now I feel like I went too far into my personal life so i'll stop writing right here. Last thing i'm going to say is, I wouldn't be mad if i'm not accepted as a moderator or anything, it's only a thing I want to try out, but if I do get accepted i'll make sure it was worth it. Thanks for reading.  -Lookslikeyoureeit aka nmhs aka Luka	0-3 months	I actually had a 2 years old account, which has gotten hacked so I'm unable to use it anymore, but I was a part of the community for longer then I specified, I just thought it would look suspicious afterwords, but now I decided to say it. Honestly I would like to be critical, but there's not a lot of things to be critical of. The current mods are doing an amazing job of, not only cleaning up the subreddit of all the posts and comments that bypass the rules, but of interacting with the community in a fun and a creative way.
5/31/2015 9:21:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/Wilsen	GMT+2	19	No.	Yes. I have owned my own servers and also been an admin for multiple communities throughout my ~7 years in the game.	A great initiative. It especially functions great for the more 'lonely' players as they then meet new people and all that jazz.	Another great initiative. It is great for the community too be accepting towards the newer people and therefore reply to their questions with genuine replies. 	So umm. I'm a 19 year old male living in Denmark. I like to play classical music, which I've played for over 10 years. In my spare time I play CS:GO (I also go to school, though) with my friends - we have a very low tier team. I'm also very fond of my playstation 4 and I use it whenever Steam is down.	4-6 months	At first, I thought it was somewhat elitist, but after browsing for a while, I really find the community to be very helpful and I have grown to love it.
5/31/2015 9:24:35	https://www.reddit.com/user/bLu51o/	UTC+9	22		Years back before Counter-Strike:Global Offensive came out, I spent many hours in playing Counter-Strike 1.6. In my CS career, I've joined 3 Clans that were very well-known and populated (LiveFree -LF-, ON24 -=[on 24]=-, TheCommission -tC-). All of the clans that I was in, I achieved the highest rank . I was the Co-owner of the clan TheCommission and I was mainly the one who was setting up the servers config/plugins and the clan website forums. We had several servers running at one time. A casual Pub server, Aim map server, PUG server, Private ten-man server. Our servers were hosted by nfoservers and we had a package deal that came with a Ventrilo server and of course HLTV. We had a CS:GO server once, but it needed a lot of maintenance to keep it up and running and not many people joined so after a few weeks, we had it taken down.	I like the idea of Community Night. It's a great way to interact with people who visit the subreddit forum and also to have good time.	CS:GO community is growing so there's bound to have more new people coming in and I think it's a great way to help those who are new to the game and give them good input so that they may continue to play it. I'm all in helping expand the community.	Hello, my name is Ryan and I am a Korean-American citizen who was born in California. I'm living in South Korea and I am unemployed at the moment but currently searching to find an English-teaching job. I've been playing Counter-Strike (mainly 1.6/GO) for over 10 years and I have a lot of knowledge of the game itself and in the competitive stage. I've been in 3 clans, given privilege to maintain the server and the forums. Although, I'm living in South Korea, I mainly play in the NA matchmaking servers with my friends and at times I solo in either faceit/esea SEA servers when they're offline. I've been visiting the GlobalOffensive subreddit daily and checking on it hourly for new posts, announcements, updates, etc.	4-6 months	I think the GlobalOffensive community in the state itself is fine the way it is right now. I've been a member of this community for nearly over a month so I can't notice much of a change. :/
5/31/2015 9:26:38	https://www.reddit.com/user/JeffTheCatN7/	GMT+0	15	I don't know any code but I'm considering trying to learn CSS	I admin a steam group that has 6,000+ members. I also helped out in a GMod server a year back but that's been shut down for quite a long time	I've been too busying studding to take part, but I've always wanted to join in	I've read almost all of them since I started coming to the subreddit, but I've never participated in one	Not much to say really. I like video games, Counter Strike is probably my favourite but other than that there really isn't much to say :P	7-9 months	I think the community is one of the better ones on reddit. In my time visiting I've not seen many people being rude or disrespectful.
5/31/2015 9:34:00	https://www.reddit.com/user/Charleyisawsome/	GMT+1	15	I am following an online course in Javascript and am not competent enough yet to be viewed as someone who can code.	Nay.	I think that especially the play testing is a good thing as it helps out the map makers get feedback they might not get if they don't have access too a server where people can play test it whenever. 	Not really necessary as there a lot of things you can find out just by googling "CS:Go tutorials".	I can learn a lot from seeing other people do something, for example; I (subconsciously) taught myself English when I was ~7-8 years old by watching "The A-team" with subtitles. Side-note: I just lurk so by looking at my posting history you can't tell that I'm an active member. but you probably guessed that was the case.	0-3 months	very nice compared too other communities with comparable sizes, such as Dota 2/league of legends/call of duty.
5/31/2015 9:31:51	http://www.reddit.com/user/aprancingelephant/	GMT+1	17	Limited knowledge in python, but taking a computing course in which we are learning java next year.		Do not take part. But I would like to try.	Do not take part.	I am a student in sixth form (Not sure what the EU/US equivalent is) in the UK, currently taking; higher maths, higher physics and computing at A level (again, not sure what the EU/US equivalent is) . All the time I spend at home I will be on reddit (mainly /r/GlobalOffensive) if not primarily it will be in the background tabs with me checking every ten minutes for new posts ect. I have a lot of free time and most of this is spent with me on my computer, this leaves me with a lot of time to be browsing reddit. For a long time I just browsed reddit however I am just now (in the last month or so) getting in to posting my own posts. I am a level headed individual, but I also like to joke around a lot. I have a fairly extensive knowledge of computers in all aspects except programming, where I only have limited knowledge in python. I do like to express my opinions on subjects but in a polite manner, not just flaming at the first response I get. It is pretty much the end of the academic year and that means I will probably have a summer spending way too much time than I probably should on my pc, this means even more time for reddit :)	10-12 months	Mostly good, but people seem to be too quick to jump on bandwagons for certain opinions, this leads to many of the same posts about meaningless hate for whichever company is in the "spotlight" currently. People don't seem to think for themselves, they let the top submissions think for them and just go along with whatever they say. If every opinion was justified I would not mind, but there seems to be many posts about disliking something with little to no justification as to why. 
5/31/2015 9:34:04	http://reddit.com/u/netronx	GMT+2	15	none	I was admin on few local CS 1.6 servers, they were pretty popular and almost full	It is really cool, i never actualy anticipated in one but i love playing 10-mans so it have to be really good. I never gave it a try becasue i dont want to download mumble	good way that lesser players can learn something, when i was silver and nova i always asked something and people were really helpful to me 	i'm from slovakia, currently studying 1st year on high school. I love playing csgo daily (currently DMG) and spend about a hour on csgo and lol subreddit daily. I always wanted to try moderating some forum becasue when i was admin on servers it was really fun experience. i also play lol sometimes where i am silver 1 currently. aside Pc stuff i also play tennis and love cycling. 	7-9 months	I think it is really good (compared to LoL,hearthstone and hltv community) and there are lot of mature people
5/31/2015 9:38:18	http://reddit.com/user/Randomees	GMT+8	23	I used to learn C++,  Java and Visual Basic .NET but that was back in college.  Current course has zero programming subjects	Honestly, no because none of my friends have the interest to host with me. 	Seems fun, only if they weren't limited to NA and EU. 	I like it. Its more of a recurring sticky for newbies and I will also be posting questions if I have any. 	I'm a Youtuber(UserU) that uploads gameplay and review videos of Counter-Strike Online. I'm also an administrator of the CSO Wikia under the same name.   I love both CSGO and CSO and play both of them regularly so if you have any inquiries, just shoot me a PM :) 	0-3 months	Based on my  observations,  the responses are pretty straighforward,  unlike LoL
5/31/2015 9:51:47	http://www.reddit.com/user/Saint_Gayben	GMT+1	16	Nope.	Nope.	It's cool, I've participated twice, and it's always fun getting together with the community for some fun games.	I haven't really checked it out, but sounds great if it's helping the newbs.	Okey, so I'm from Norway, I like playing football and hanging out with friends/playing games in my spare time. I also love taco, and watching movies/shows/twitch streams :^)	10-12 months	Well, honestly, I think the /r/GlobalOffensive is pretty interesting, it's very often filled with a high variation of different kinds of posts, which I really like.
5/31/2015 9:53:30	http://reddit.com/user/Un1Verse_	GMT-4	19	I am currently majoring in the computer science field. From 2013, I have been doing minor website design for clients, and I would consider myself very knowledgeable with regards to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In addition to that, I've dabbled in PHP, so I know a little bit about creating web modules, web applications, etc. I used to own a website as well (firexgaming.com) which was unfortunately forced to dissolve because of the lack of community funding.	For almost a year, I've been an admin of the False Hope Gaming servers (denoted by FH, you may have seen them in your server browser). While the website is still rather rudimentary, we currently have around 20 servers, with minigames, DM, retakes, and more. We are currently hosting on a multiverse setting, with all the servers connected via a common host. They are all located with Northeast USA, and we have several thousand members, of which several hundred log on within a daily basis. We cater to large amount of players, mostly from the US, but we do get a decent number of Europeans as well.	From the community nights I've been a part of, I can confidently say that I thoroughly enjoy them. They are a great way to bring together the community, and meet new people. To be honest, the only thing I could see to improve them is to have more of them! The community of /r/globaloffensive is so large, servers fill up almost instantly, leaving a lot of players waiting for an open spot. I'm not quite sure how many servers you currently have, but I feel like community nights are one of the main reasons many people frequent the subreddit, and I can't really see anything wrong about it.	Newbie Thursday is a great idea, in theory, but I really feel like it should get more publicity. Every single day, I see many, many threads created by people looking to get a question answered, most of which are quite simple. One thing that I saw on another subreddit, however, is that they had a week-long megathread, full of people looking for help in something. I don't know if something like that would be possible, but in my opinion, I think it would greatly reduce the amount of useless threads/spam, making the job easier for the moderators.	As mentioned before, I'm a 19 year old student, currently majoring in Computer Science at Princeton University. I've been playing Counter-Strike since the age of 11, and I began with Counter-Strike: Source, which I was introduced to by my older brother, who was at the time a prominent player in the CAL leagues. Since then, it has consumed a major portion of my life, and I spend a lot more time playing than I should :P. Aside from playing CS and reddit, I enjoy playing chess and tennis in my free time, and I'm trying to develop some open-source web applications, though it's not going well so far. When I play CS, I enjoy trading as well as kz/bhop.	7-9 months	While I do dislike the term "circlejerk", I feel like that is exactly what a large portion of Reddit tends to follow. Quite often, I see one of those extremely large threads, gaining thousands of upvotes. These threads are accusations, false feedback, witch-hunt, etc. One of my biggest concerns is that I think mods should be deleting these, given the insane amount of turmoil it stirs up within the community. Take, for example, the flusha hackusations. The /r/globaloffensive community is massive, and this is awesome. But to maintain such a massive community, certain precautions should be taken.
5/31/2015 9:58:35	http://reddit.com/user/Katashi	GMT-5	16	Unfortunately I do not have any experience coding. Although I don't have any currently, it is definitely something I'd be interesting in learning at some point. 	I do have quite a bit of administrative experience when it comes to servers on the counter-strike games. Years ago when source was popular I was an admin on a fairly popular Warcraft source server and held that position for a year or so. Although I was much younger than I am now and obviously wasn't very good at my position, it was a nice learning experience. Beyond that, I've been an admin on a couple different other source servers and a few global offensive servers but they're not really anything important enough to go in to full detail about. To break away from admining on counter-strike, I've always held positions on different Gmod servers aswell. Keep in mind that the position I held was pretty simple and I might not have as much experience as other members of the community that have administrated previously.	Community night in my opinion is a great way for the counter-strike community to get together, meet new people and have fun playing the game with other dedicated counter-strike players in the CS:GO community. Although I may have not participated in this event before as I haven't really been interested in it, If I were to become a mod I'd probably enjoy participating because I'd actually have a reason to. 	Newbie Thursday is extremely cool to me. It's WONDERFUL to see a community I'm decently active in come together in one big thread to help out new players with questions they may have. It's a great way to get everybody involved, help out new players to the game / community and it's a great learning experience for everybody involved. I know for a fact if I were new to CS:GO and I came across a newbie thursday thread, I'd be ecstatic. 	Hi!   My real name is Joey and I'm a pretty easy going goofy fella. I play CS:GO frequently if I'm not playing TF2 or any other game of the sort. I'm a really mellow guy most of the time and I don't USUALLY get in arguments with anybody if I can prevent it. My hobbies include: Listening to music, watching anime, making dumb videos & pictures that me and my friends laugh at for hours, goofing around with my friends in teamspeak and giggling uncontrollably at things that really aren't that funny at all. There really isn't much to me, I'm a simple guy. If there is anything else you'd like to know about me, don't be afraid to ask. ;)  Thank you for taking the time to read my process my application!	7-9 months	Overall I'm pretty happy with how the community is, but in saying this I don't mean there isn't problems that could be worked on. Sometimes when I see a post, I feel like I shouldn't read the comments at all because half of the time it's a bunch of trolls flaming somebody else, calling someone out on their rank or knowledge and just ruining an average user's experience when browsing. Although I know this really isn't something that the community as a whole can prevent (there is always going to be a few bad apples), I feel as if I were to become a mod this is something I'd try and work on to prevent. Sometimes the subreddit feels like a twitch chat and it's pretty disheartening.  Although there are a few issues which can be prevented, I'm pretty happy with the subreddit's community and I am definitely going to stick around.
5/31/2015 10:02:07	https://www.reddit.com/user/robbert_jansen/	UTC+1	17	Minimal HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,PHP experience	Yes i'm currently hosting 9 public csgo servers and the occasional private server on a Strato level 3  windows server in Germany.  http://www.gametracker.com/clan/HouseOfFrags/ https://www.strato.nl/dedicated-server-windows/  Intel® Xeon® E3-1230v2 4x3,3 GHz 8 GB RAM 2x1 TB     	It's fun when the games are balanced but generally it's not because of the massive skill gap .  But i love the play testing nights too bad the map is usually only played once.	I don't have an opinion on this since i generally don't participate in these threads	My name is Robbert as you can see in my reddit username.  I've been on reddit for about 2,5 years now, in this time i have never been a subreddit moderator before but would like to be one.   i have technically been a subreddit mod before but that is because i've made my own subreddits to test how it works  I've played csgo for almost 2 years now and it's my first cs (i'm not counting the time i played 1.6 on my original xbox 10+ years ago)  i'm quite the perfectionist if i do something i wanna do it right, this can get in the way of doing stuff because it might take me longer because it has to be pefect.  I visit this subreddit ALOT multiple hours a day every day.  that's about it ;)    	13-18 months	The community tends to exaggerate issues alot and state their options as facts which is something i hate,  But in general my opinions are usually similar to that of the community so there is very little conflict between me and the rest of the community
5/31/2015 10:03:21	http://reddit.com/user/Limpan69	UTC+1	14	No  If it matters i use Linux.	No	We need those, not just the reddit community nights. I havent installed Mumble yet so i cant join them but i will soon enough.	We should have 2 a week, 1 isnt enough. Everyone can ask questions and will get them answered.	My name is Linus Niskala, and I play both Football and CS on my sparetime. I'm pretty much a regular 8'th grader with bad grades in almost everything except physical activities and English. My dream is to become a pro-cs player and I am ready to sacrifice my friends and family if it means i can become one. I often don't take that much responsibillities unless it is in CS, so I rely way to much on my parents, maybe a reason why I shouldn't be a mod. As a person, you might find me a very kind and a good person when you have trouble, since I will always be there to help someone. I also had/have some anger issues, but I don't get that mad as i used to do, but it is mostly IRL when I get mad.	0-3 months	I love it. It is a great community which might have some bad apples, but if you compare them to games like HoN and LoL, it is the best one out there with such a big playerbase. We always have new idéas and often know what is wrong with the game, even if we exaggerate a bit.
5/31/2015 10:22:38	http://www.reddit.com/user/Tofushy	GMT+9:30	16	Basic experience in HTML (old), Some CSS experience as well from multimedia classes.	Not on CS:GO community servers, but on TF2 servers in the past where I have been a leading developer and a head administrator on. I have been on CS:GO community servers and the concept is mostly the same, so hopefully that gives some merit to my TF2ness. 	I only wish that it was hosted at a time appropriate for the OCE scene, especially during weekdays. If I had an opportunity to play at a decent time I would most likely thing more highly of it however I still think it's a great way to get the community together.	Newbie Thursday is highly beneficial to not only those who ask questions in the thread, but those who ask questions because sometimes I see disputes and discussion and this further analysis + discussion on these questions and threads sets a good example for newbies to CS:GO and its reddit. I've used it myself and lurked for ages on it since it started and I do find it very useful every time I use it, so overall my thoughts on Newbie Thursday are highly positive.	I'm a very experienced lurker. To be honest, sending in this mod app will most likely be a fruitless effort considering my reddit overview is pretty much crap, but I have been lurking the CS:GO reddit long since I created an account and I just tend to be quite procrastinatory when it comes to these sorts of things. From my past forum experience in 2009 to 2013, I can say that sometimes, shutting up is a much better option than to speak simply because there are people who are immature and might not like what you want to say. I've always just liked to sit back and read, analyse and have a laugh or two at what people are saying; I'm a pretty decent expert at that sort of thing so I suppose that would be a reason I am applying for the moderator position here at the CS:GO reddit. I enjoy working by myself most of the time as I believe I function the best whenever I can collect my thoughts and make an informed decision on my own, however working with a team is no issue for me and when surrounded by people who are as mature as I'd like to think I am, I work very well with these people in terms of bouncing ideas off of each other and executing them. Also, I'm a hella big nerd and I like MLP. Don't play much sport, usually just playing CS:GO and finishing off assignments in my last year of school. I'm an Australian Year 12 (senior year) and I don't see much Australian represent on the reddit so that would be pretty nice to have on the mod team, I'm not really sure what else to say, but I hope you definitely put some consideration into my application, despite my lack of credible evidence. I've been around longer than 4-6 months, maybe like 9, but again, thank you beebs!	4-6 months	My thoughts on the GlobalOffensive community are mainly positive. Everyone seems to enjoy each other and have their jokes in the fluff and image threads, and are able to switch to a mature, analytical persona when  dealing with a proper discussion thread. I haven't seen the moderators do anything brash, and with the recent banner competition I've seen a lot of community togetherness and collaboration. I firmly believe that the GlobalOffensive community is one of the better reddit communities, hence why I only post here, as seeing some of the other reddits has seriously put me off them. Like, seriously?? Have you guys seen some of the lame reddits out there? I don't even really want to talk about them...but damn. Those things exist and that scares me. But yeah, overall, relative to other reddits and prety much just absolute, the GlobalOffensive community reigns supreme. I enjoy my time on the reddits and I look forward to seeing more funny images, discussions and match speculation (STOP SPOILING IT FOR ME).
5/31/2015 10:11:59	http://reddit.com/u/ItsJustSketchyy	GMT+10	19	Unfortunately not, I'd be willing to learn it if needed though!	I admin my teams scrim server, but that generally does not have much traffic. I do know most if not all important server commands though.	I haven't paid too much attention to Community Nights as they only seem to apply to NA and EU (correct me if I'm wrong). They seem like a great way for mapmakers to get feedback and are also a fun experience to meet some new cs:go players.	I think Newbie Thursday is quite useful, even as an experience player I find myself making use of some of the advice in that thread. Seeing as the subreddit is continuing to grow in players, it would be useful to keep the weekly post going as more new players join the community.	Hi, my name is Patrick and I've been playing CS:GO since November last year. Since then I've racked up over 800 hours in play and have been involved in the competitive, trading and betting communities of the game, although I've completely stopped betting and trading since a few months ago. For the past half year I've lived and breathed counter strike. I've watched most games of the past two majors and tend to watch a casual game every other day. To be honest when I'm not playing cs I'm usually browsing reddit, especially now since I'm taking a break from Uni for the next year or so. In terms of moderating experience, I'm currently a mod over at /r/iZombie which is a subreddit about the CW show. It's only a small community with ~2000 subs, but I've taken the time to learn all the moderation tools, so I guess I have a bit of experience. So yeah, that's all I can really think about right now, I guess if you guys are interested in trying me out you'll get to know me better, thanks for giving us the opportunity to apply!	10-12 months	I haven't had a single negative experience on the subreddit so far, although I don't go seeking a fight or argument, so that's probably a big part of it. I think the content being seen on the front page is relevant and often informative and I'm honestly quite happy with the state of the subreddit.
5/31/2015 10:28:19	http://www.reddit.com/user/Zeb58	GMT+2	17	No	I have never hosted a CS:GO server, I never tried it. I know how to use the console, that's all.  I was the admin of a Minecraft server of about 20 players. The players were mostly friends, but also a few people I didn't know. Apart from building on the server myself I check if everyone followed the rules. It was great fun but after a while we just stopped playing. 	I think it's great to come together as a community and playtest maps. We have already seen that the CS:GO devs look at the Reddit, so testing maps and giving our opinion is a great way to help CS:GO and the mapmakers.	It's a good way for people to get tips to get better. It is easier to get small questions answered. Ask it on a larger thread instead of making a small post that only a few people see.	My name is Zeb, I'm 17 years old and I live in The Netherlands. I'm at the end of the first year of university at the moment. I will be more active in a few weeks because of my summer break. I have been playing Counter-Strike for about 1.5 years, so I'm still learning a lot. I know a lot of tactics and strats but I still need to adapt it in game. I browse Reddit a few hours a day usually. /r/GlobalOffense is the subreddit I browse the most. I don't have a high karma because I don't post often but like answering people's questions. That's why I would like to be an moderator, to help the community and make the subreddit better.	4-6 months	Every community has it's flaws but overall I think this community is great. I really like the fact that we as a community make a change to the game. Pointing out flaws and bugs so the devs can fix it.
5/31/2015 10:30:44	http://reddit.com/u/raskafari	UTC+1	23	Learned HTML, CSS and Javascript when I took my bachelors degree in Multimedia Technology, but I was shit at it. Preferred to make silly drawings and playing with physics engines in maya.	Not really, other than messing with console commands. 	Probably a good thing, I don't know .	HEH, newbs. 	I like to ban people. Especially memers.   Also, I am not a wordy person. 	3-4 years	Too many memes. 
5/31/2015 10:32:44	https://www.reddit.com/user/AdrineXD/	UTC+2	20	I know basic things on HTML and some PHP and CSS	I've been running some servers for my friends on CSS and now i run my team prac server on CSGO from my own computer with eBot on it	Played couple of times and had fun,	i don't really know anything to say i've never looked at those threads.	I'm pretty social and have great sense of humor. I used to make youtube videos and got around 7k subscribers and thought it's not my style and started streaming some times. i'm currently unemployed and going to start school this autumn. I really like video games and helping people. My current rank is global elite and i know this doesn't effect your mod pick but eh, isn't it impressive :)	13-18 months	I really like the community and the people here also it's great to see how this community is raising and so strong.
5/31/2015 10:37:59	http://www.reddit.com/user/zankoas/	GMT+0	16	Though not fluent, I have learnt bits of HTML, Java, Python and MS-DOS, if you count that as a coding language. I can just up and write any of them, but if asked to read, or isolate a string etc I would be able to do that.	I have been a mod for a project zomboid server, very small, a terraria server, again very small, but also a slightly larger minecraft server. The first two were hosted of my computer, the later was a paid service. The miencraft server got about 20 people, but nothing big really. I am also running my own TS server that gets used for CSGO mostly, again about 20 people.	Sadly, never got involved, but the idea seems very cool.	Great! Since getting into CSGO about 10 months ago, it has been amazingly helpful, I haven't asked any questions on it, but the best bit of it, for me anyway, is reading the question I wouldn't even think to ask.	Hi!  My name is Charlie, I'm a GN4 and my life goal is to get to AK.  Really though, I'm one of the players that game from league to csgo. I never quite *clicked* with league, but all my friends played it so, I did. About 6 months ago a few friends of mine played a little csgo and I joined in, hooked instantly. I have got 300+ hours in those 6 months, even with a set of exams in the middle (opps...). I'm doing my AS levels now, well, next week is the last week so nearly over. I tend to follow the watch and observe philosophy, which is why my reddit account has near to no activity, despite me using it daily, but that could be useful for a mod, no feeling the need to comment? I don't really no what else to say, I love reading and runnning, and my computer is my lovely lovely hand crafted baby.  P.S. I lied about my life goal, actually, it is to own a stattrak karambit fade, and I am thinking of pawning of my baby to get one...	10-12 months	I joined csgo about 10 months ago, and started looking at the Reddit at the same time, but only really get fully into it about 6 months ago. I such I watched csgo go from a sideline e-sport to now one of the biggest (csgo>dota2 only a few days ago). The growth of the reddit has been amazing, every day I check, sometimes 2 or three times a day, there is always new content, and thanks to more votes, the good stuff heads to the top fast. The community has a great sense of humour, and some amazing talent, some videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVVByFp6qhE) have had me laughing out load. The only slight criticism I could mention is times when I feel the intervention has been slightly to heavy handed, I can't think of an example of the top of my head though, so I guess it can't happen that often.
5/31/2015 10:40:32	https://www.reddit.com/user/grizzgreeley/	GMT+12	22	I have a bit of knowledge in all kinds of code even tho it has been a while. Some of the main forms of code that I have learnt are Robot c, HTML, phpBB, I will say I don't remember much of the coding I have learnt but I could pick it up quite quickly again if needed.	Not in CS:GO, but I did in source, I use to be one of the long time admins for the Surf-Infamous community. We use to run a lot of servers, and had a reasonably busy forums that we had to administer. We had multiple game servers over different games like tf2, gmod etc. On Source our main servers we had were jail break servers, and surf servers, but over time we had different mod's on servers based on what the community wanted. At times our Jailbreak servers had the highest average number of players across the world. I my self have administrated many server's back in the source days, including running my own GunGame server for around about a year.	I think it's a really good idea! its always good to have community get together's, it makes the community more tightly knit. 	I think It is really good having a place where people can go and ask questions with out being flamed.	So I'm from little old New Zealand, I have been around the Counter strike community for around about 7+ years, I did take break for a few years and played a lot of LoL, but I seem to have had my heart recaptured to counter strike again, so I am really wanting contribute to the community like I use to. If you were ever around the OCE CS:S scene then you may know of me, my in-game name is EpicKills. So currently I work in a taxi call center,  dealing with all the drunks wanting to get home late at night. I my self am some what newish to the r/GlobalOffensive, and have more or less been some what lurking around reading most of the stuff that is posted on there. I don't normally comment on things unless I feel like I have something worth while to contribute.  Also here is a link to my steam profile: steamcommunity.com/id/epickills/	0-3 months	I think the community is actually pretty good. I'm still some what new around here, but I am learning and am quite liking this community 
5/31/2015 10:44:07	http://www.reddit.com/user/videogamelover	UTC-5	14	tiny ammounts of LUA from playing and hosting GMOD and Payday servers	Yes, i have been an admin on Garrys mod, and CSGO servers.	havent participated	i think that newbie thursday (i thought it was tuesday???) is a good idea for new players to learn how to play	i love computers and videogames, i built my first computer when i was seven and ive been playing videogames since i was a toddler,i have loads of free time, especially with summer coming up. and i browse reddit daily. im currently taking all advanced courses in school and im going into the 9th grade.	10-12 months	I think it has an interesting mix of personalities, there are salty people, and there are friendly and helpful people. 
5/31/2015 10:47:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheFlyingSquirrel1/	GMT-4	16	CSS HTML and C	I have been an admin on a former community The Respected Few (it was a jailbreak server)	It is fun I have been to a few	very good and helpful	I love reddit and CSGO I think the community is great and you mods have done really well with it. I'm in high school and have a lot of free time to spend on reddit and CSGO (http://steamcommunity.com/id/NestoR1). I am patient and respectful of other mods and people. I like helping people and being active in the community. Thanks for reading.	13-18 months	Great and helpful group of people
5/31/2015 10:52:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/-Se7eN-/	GMT+1	18	I have experience in Javascript, HTML and CSS but further experience in other lesser known languages, is something I find easy and learn fast.	I admin a server for my CS:GO team, but before that I was the head administrator of (the third largest I believe) DayZ Mod sever, we had over 200 members and the server was usually very busy. It required a lot of manual care (back then anti cheat was awful) and scripting fixes. I have since been added as a community developer for the DayZ mod from this experience. I know this varies in many ways from CS but I feel the experience is still valid. 	I like the idea of it, gives people more variety in CS:GO and shows that there is more to the game than de_dust2.	I love it, the concept is brilliant, I used to be an active member on /r/csgocritic but it took me around an hour to evaluate and write my reviews on peoples demos. I'm all up for assisting newer players. 	I'm an ex IT student, I have dropped education for sometime in the pursuit of my development career, because of this I spend a lot of time at home just developing random things and playing my favorite shooter CS:GO.   It should also be mentioned that because i'm home most of the time and currently have no work schedule I am very active and are usually on very late.   I have a semi professional team that has some sponsors, nothing too serious but its fun and gives me a challenge which is something I always look for.  I have come to be really fond of the CS community and try to give back what I can, whether that be reviewing someones demo, helping a friend improve, making maps in the Hammer editor or maybe even helping reddit uphold its friendly and enjoyable environment, every person I have suggested the GO reddit to has loved it, and I don't think that happens because the moderation team sits back and hopes it works out, I can tell a lot of effort is put into the reddit and that's why I love being here.  Also, I forgot to mention, I'm Sven! Nice to meet you. 	19-24 months	I like it for the most part! I think people are always active in showing new and interesting things that happen in their games and that makes a reddit fun, I think a lot of great humor is generated by the community (one of the things that makes me want to actively view the reddit). I never played source or 1.6, I only played go shortly after it came out and fell inlove with it, so I think that gives me a slightly different perspective than some of the older players. For the most part I like it, being a sort of developer myself I sometimes am torn when I see posts sometimes negatively speaking about valve and how they handle things but id be lying if I said i've never felt the same way.
5/31/2015 11:08:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheTomiSVK/	GMT+1	15	Java 7 (Javascript), GML, Little bit of C++	I've been hosting some servers (Minecraft, GMod and also CS:GO - for a while) on own server. I've also been mod on one 1.6 server (can't remember the name now).	I've never been on any, but i think they might be great.	I like reading it. I've learned some useful tricks few times. 	I think i should start by introducing myself. My name is Tomáš (Thomas). I'm from Slovakia. I've been playing CS:GO for 3/4 year. (DMG). And also playing cs 1.6 for few years. I've been reading this subreddit for 4-5 months. I haven't been very active in discussions, but I've been reading almost every post everyday. I'm also helping some people on steam discussions (In cs:go section).  I want to become a mod to pay off my debt to the community.	4-6 months	Actually, I like it. Sometimes i found some really shitty posts or trolls in the comments. On the other side, there is lot of intersting and funny posts. If i got some questions about the game or updates, I can always find it here.
5/31/2015 11:13:24	http://www.reddit.com/user/Xenez/	GMT-4	15	Javascript		Good idea and a great way to get the community involved in testing maps, helping map creators. I would give an announcement of community night 24 hours in advance because some people wont see the 3 hour heads-up until it is too late	Great way to let new players ask questions, maybe add video tutorials of common question such as pro player tutorials on spraying, awping, practicing, etc. Also need to add gd_ maps to the map section of faq	I enjoy playing and watching CS, I always look forward to a good game of CS. I have become very involved in the scene, watching pro games, playing on a team, and even starting to cast a little in my free time. I have am understanding on how most things in this game work so I will be able to answer anyone's questions if needed. There is nothing worse when a community you love starts to turn toxic, luckily we have very few of those people in our community. I would do my best to keep making our community an awesome place.  I think I will bring a lot to the table if you choose to accept me, I have a few ideas that would improve the subreddit, such as a possible community twitch channel where people could apply to stream there and they could teach or entertain our community. Maybe even use it to help their own channel grow too. Thank you for considering me, Chris	10-12 months	The community is not afraid to be critical, sometimes they are too critical because they don't understand how things work behind the scenes. Otherwise we have a great community!
5/31/2015 11:23:44	http://www.reddit.com/user/Baesic14/	GMT-6	14	no	no	I think it's a really great thing to have and I will be participating more now that school is out.	It helped me a lot through my road from Silver 4 to Legendary Eagle, I got a lot of questions answered and also have answered some myself. It's a really great thing for people of all skill levels.	I live in Katy, TX and I am 14 years old, I am going into Grade 9 next year. I play football and usually make straight As. I like building PCs and playing  all kinds of games, usually CS though.	10-12 months	Over time, I feel it has helped me improve my game a lot. I got some good questions answered, I was introduced to other CS related subreddits such as r/recruitcs and r/csgocritic that helped me find my team that I play with today. The only negative thing I have to say is maybe we could get a bot like /r/globaloffensivetrade that would redirect people to the correct subreddits if they posted something that belonged somewhere else.
5/31/2015 11:34:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/MYM_mki	UTC+2	24	Very basic in quite a few languages. I was the editor in chief of MeetYourMakers which required me to familiarize myself with a few languages to be able to improvise!	I have quite a bit of experience admining servers. During my time in a few of the organizations I have been a part of, I have also been extremely active in building a community around them. Setting up and running servers is a very easy way to do this. From game servers to voice servers I'm familiar with all types of admining regarding uploading files to FTP servers and running commands through a third party program.  I hosted servers and tournaments for MeetYourMakers, Excello and GotFrag.	Community Nights, although not a new idea, is a great initiative. It's an easy way to build an active community by giving the community something to look forward to and helping them unite together. Ten mans seem to be the easiest way to do this and I'm not sure if I can give any more feedback on this at the moment.	I had to think about this actually for a minute! Newbie Thursday is the best way to organize an "Easy questions / easy answers" topic. There are other alternatives like making just one mega-thread (answers will get lost and lose relevance) or even just not making any thread at all (same problem). Newbie Thursday is the best way I think of organizing such a thread.	I'm a long time editor in the electronic sports scene. I got my start with Counter-Strike 1.6, however, the game lost relevance when StarCraft II came out. Once CS:GO returned I came back over to Counter-Strike and am looking for a new way to get involved with the community. My past positions were Assistant Editor in Chief at Team Acer and Editor in Chief at MeetYourMakers (both were semi-professional as I was paid).  I love CS, it's truly an amazing game at a very deep level. The skill cap is amazing high as there are many ways to be good at the game (game knowledge as a leader, pure aim, economy system). /r/GlobalOffensive has slowly grown on me over the years as I used to visit the site about once a week, whereas now the website opens automatically with Google Chrome.  I would enjoy moderating /r/GlobalOffensive however also helping out in any way possible! 	10-12 months	The community is much better than other leading communities (HLTV.org comes to mind). Of course this has a lot to do with proper moderation the fact that it's an open place to voice thoughts first and foremost (not secondly like HLTV.org).   
5/31/2015 11:41:28	http://reddit.com/u/nvlbg	GMT+2	18	all listed + some java and c/c±± but mostly scripting languages. I have some certificates from google that can prove it.	Not much. I have experience in homemade 1.6 servers and that's it. Nothing big.	I haven't participated yet. It sounds awesome though.	It's a good place to ask stupid questions. I like it.	I‘m a 18 year old kid from Bulgaria. I have just finished school and now I have a lot of free time during the summer. I am accepted at the university I want to go to so I don‘t have to study for exams.   My passion beyond csgo is programming and computers as a whole. I have participated in a LOT of programming competitions since grade 8. Mostly web dev competitions but algorithmic ones too. I was a finalist in a google competition 2 years ago (google code in).  The first cs I played was 1.0 (not kidding). I didn‘t have internet then and that was the cs on my computer. I have been playing 1.6 for around 7-8 years too. I'm quite new to csgo. I have it since this february, so 4 months. I have been active on this sub since day 1 I got the game.	4-6 months	I can't believe how much time I spend in this sub. I like he content and the community, although I sometimes see toxic users.I have learned a lot of cool tricks about the game here. I got hooked to the pro scene becauseo this sub too.
5/31/2015 11:42:39	http://www.reddit.com/user/Nuclear_Bomb/	GMT-5	16	No, but I can learn very easily if there was any need for it.	I have not yet been an admin on any CS:GO server before, but I have on many Team Fortress servers before. The servers I was an admin/owner on were for trading and just for relaxing. Certain days we would have some special events that involved people who would want to join.	I love the idea of it. I love how it gets people to join with others and make many new friends. It seems like a success as of now.	I have always loved the idea of this. This makes it so much easier for new players to get help without having someone bash at them for being new. They can maneuver easier through the sub-reddits rather than just guessing and checking where you they should look for something. 	My name is Brandon. I am a 16 year old going to high school right now. I was playing CS:GO when it came out in beta up until Operation Payback and then took a break. I came back during Breakout and have been playing it since. Throughout my life, I have never been a dick to anyone. I have always tried resolving the problem without being disrespectful to anyone. Summer is coming up so I will have plenty of free time to be browsing the /rglobaloffensive subreddit and even when school starts up I can still do it after school, I will have plenty of time to do my best work.	13-18 months	The majority of the community I find is a great community (minus all the trolls in it) and it is a great community to learn from if one is just starting to play CS:GO. The one problem with the community that I have found is that when an update comes out and someone does not like it, then the whole community just turns into a riot.
5/31/2015 11:45:37	https://www.reddit.com/user/el_vper/	UTC+2	24	I cannot code but I do have made things like a chrome extension, somehow. But anything advanced? Nope.	Back in the good old days of CSS, before the update (2011?) that broke all mods I started as playing on a RPG mod server which the owner didn't care about, and gave me full controle of the server. It started as 10 players "when lucky" server & ended up as a 40 player server filled up completely for I guess about 8 hours / day. After the update that broke all mods I quited & upon my return started to play GG. I've been admin on several GG servers (and others owned by the same org): Hartz 4 Treef, Born² and THC. On THC never really was "official" admin because they had a rule that required admins to speak perfect German but I did get admin for a while as nobody else moderated the server.  Often these servers were fairly neglected concerning active admins. Being admin was in part just to enhance my own playing experience, often only applying for it after meeting a cheater on the server without any admins online to ban him...	The playtesting is interesting for map makers.	Good intentions but I have my doubts on how effective it is. FAQing some questions with a lot more solid, supported & complete answers would likely be helpful. And people should be pushed more to find their own way to play CS, if you're going to think through every move as if it's chess you'll fail. Knowledge can be used to enhance your game but it's never the foundation for a game like CSGO, but gamesense is. Everything else just adds a small layer each time.	I click a bit here, click a bit there, click a bit everywhere. Not much to say, I am not one, I am what I need to be / want to be.	4-6 months	The community is uninformed, don't think for themselves, run hehind the herder like sheep. (large part is, of course not 'every single person')  Uninformed. Example:some obvious things like buying armour not stopping aimpunch, but just reducing it isn't know by suprisingly many people.  Don't think for themselves: you'll often see people blindly supporting untrue statements which they just want to be true. A good example is "silver hell". At some point I got so fed up of hearing people blame "silver hell" constantly that I've put it to the test very thoroughly. And guess what, it doesn't exist. People just constantly look for random things to blame instead of looking at how they can improve themselves.  Run behind a herder like sheep: it's not rare to see a true statement by a random person get downvoted, and when a bit later a pro makes the exact same statement it gets like 90% upvoted. 
5/31/2015 11:53:09	http://reddit.com/u/Mcdeadwoody	GMT+1	14	I write Javascript quite well; I started in coding plugins for Minecraft back in 2013 and I loved coding Javascript in general ever since. I plan on coding for a living aswell.	No, I do not have any significant experience with admining servers unfortunately.	I haven't dwelved deep in the social side of the subreddit yet. To be honest I've been a bit of a lurker most of the time on here. At first glance I find it very exciting! I'm thrilled to see that there's a night dedicated to the community and fun activities that come along with it. It's a shame that I haven't participated in any yet.	I am, just as above, very positive about Newbie Thursday. I think it's very important to introduce new players to the subreddit or even the game. I love that the subreddit is putting so much effort into the community.	My first name is Tim, I'm born and raised in The Netherlands. I've been introduced to the internet and gaming at a very young age and have loved it since day one.  I basically taught myself English. I'm not completely fluent; I tend to make small spelling mistakes once in a while. I'm always looking to improve and with that mentality I've become a very good English speaker.  I'm very eager to learn and discover. I love to know things and live for the facts. I'm very interested in physics, maths, all that stuff. This is mostly why I've been involved in coding too.  You could call me an outcast, I've never been very popular. But then again, we're all quite alike here in /r/GlobalOffensive.  You wouldn't call me a very social person at first glance. And that's partly true, I'm not an extreme "people's" kind of guy. I do very much enjoy socializing with others and participate in social events, etc.  I mostly spend the day behind the computer. I'm not a real jock or anything, but I get around. I've started playing Counter-Strike about a year and a half ago, I previously enjoyed games such as the Mario series, the Binding of Isaac and Minecraft. 	10-12 months	In my personal opinion I find the /r/GlobalOffensive community for the most part very friendly and welcoming.  There is ofcourse some parts I can criticize about, such as the community looking down upon certain nationalities (mostly Russians) and stereotypes. This is the most major flaw I see with the community.  I think it's important to respect every single person no matter where they come from and as a moderator I would not tolerate such discriminative behaviour. 
5/31/2015 11:56:44	https://www.reddit.com/user/AquamarineRevenge/	UTC-5	30	I am a masters student in computer science, graduating in about a year so yes, I know my way around code.  I can be of use with HTML, Javascript, Python for sure and probably others on the list above with just a little practice.	I've only experimented with this for a short time, and it was on a separate first person shooter from CS GO.  Definitely interested though!	I think it is a great idea.	Great idea.	So, I'm 30 years old, I really love CS GO and have been playing and immersing myself in the culture of the game when I have time.  My main time sink in life at this point is being a masters computer science student, I'm quite often working on homework or some app to put in my portfolio.  My goal is to be a software engineer in the not distant future, I'll be taking shots at applying for new grad positions at all the big tech companies in about 7 or 8 months. It would be awesome to work for Valve or Blizzard one day also, interviewed with Blizz for an internship recently.  Mostly why I want this is I'm a pretty big fan of CS GO, I enjoy the game and the community, I feel I have some skill with code that could be of use to you, and I'm also at a place in life right now where I have time to dedicate to modding.  Outside of being a full time student doing this career change I am in, I have the time and dedication to help this community however it needs it!  Last thing I want to say is I do have some mod exp with modding r/scala.  I am happy to take direction in how to mod.  I have been apart of a few communities in my time where mods were clearly on a power trip and it absolutely ruined the community for me.  This is something I try to keep in the forefront of my mind when modding.  As a mod I feel I am there to simply clean things up when they need to be and only contriubute to making it better in as subtle a way as possible.  If I end up a mod, please know that I will mod selflessly on behalf of the community and there will be no power trips or any of the other worries associated with someone's personality melding with their mod status.  Thanks for your time in considering me, and thanks for your time in modding also.  This is a great subreddit!	0-3 months	I've been subscribed for maybe 6 months on a separate account (not banned or anything, just wanted a nice username change, you can check my other account u/ranci) and I really enjoy it.  I have lurked and read much more than I have posted though.
5/31/2015 12:03:10	http://www.reddit.com/user/xCR0SSx/	GMT+4	13	Planning to start learning soon.	Nope.  EDIT : Actually, not sure I'm ready for mod. Just ignore everything, sorry for wasting your time!	No thoughts.	It's got a lot of good information for new players from what I've seen.	I'm an active member of /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade and I lurk a lot on /r/GlobalOffensive. I like trap music, I like cats, I really like computers. I also like to help people trade (I'm currently doing that actually with a BFK CW FN) and I don't do any vote manipulation tho I don't really wanna report friends that ask for it, but it's mainly on /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade. I traded up for $30 to $2000 in 8 months, and I cashed out $1200 and kept $600. I'm friends with a few of the mods over there and if I see something, I'll report it.	7-9 months	Personally, I think it's getting better, there are a lot of "Hey valve fix this little bug" posts and still funny posts as well as "news"  if you can call it that. This sub is basically all I use for CS news. 
5/31/2015 12:01:15	http://reddit.com/u/nownewstart	UTC+2	17	PHP, CSS, Basic Javascript, HTML, Basic Python, Basic NodeJS experience.  Hobby developer :)	I do own a few csgo servers, but only for me and my friends.   It runs metamod, sourcemod and needed plugins, works pretty fine :)	I like it, I sometimes play in it when I got the time for it	A good thread to answer newbie questions. People can learn a lot with reading through the questions and the answers to it	I'm currently living in Germany, visiting school to get my A-Levels to study information technology. In my free time I play cs, osu! and develop things, such as http://csnades.com   I also enjoy moderating communities quite a lot. I am a moderator of a big twitch community with currently 110k followers if I recall correctly.	10-12 months	I like it, sometimes it can get AIDS, but that's pretty normal in a big community.
5/31/2015 12:08:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/SporkEUW	GMT+2	18	I know HTML5, basic JS and CSS. Will be studying IT in the future in the university.	Unfortunately I don't have experience in this.	Seems like fun and I'd personally love to take part in them, but haven't had the time to do so yet due to MM taking up time.	When I started playing CS (a few months back), I found some of the information on these threads helpful and I support the idea, since it may be of assistance to new players.	I was diagnosed with Leukemia 1.5 years ago and had a stem cell transplant a year ago. I've been away from school for the entire time and have had a lot of time to browse reddit and enjoy various games. I have a ton of time on my hands and if I have nothing 'intellectual' to do, I end up just spending it on something useless. I spend a lot of time on Twitch also, so moderating can be done simultaneously and I could cut some time off gaming also.   I speak fluent English and Finnish. Basics of Swedish, French and Spanish. Although living in Finland, I've been in English speaking schools all the time and my English is better grammatically than my Finnish.   Thanks for your time!	0-3 months	At it's current state there is a lot that could be better. I see a ton of negativity in some cases, but when there are positive comments I do truly enjoy spending time browsing here. But there will always be people hating on others and getting a laugh out of it and sometimes I also do find the negative things funny.
5/31/2015 12:12:26	http://reddit.com/u/balfong	UTC+1	25	No	No	Love it! I've tried it a few times and think it's an excellent way to get the community together and create friendship.	Great idea for beginners who might be insecure about creating a new submission just to ask a question. Plus it's good for the community to collect all questions in one thread instead of many seperate threads.	My name is Martin, 25 years old living in Sweden with my wife and daughter, 7 months old named Sansa (yeah we like Game of thrones). 3 years ago i didn't even want kids, but wouldn't change that ever, and we might even get her a sibling  I work as an paramedic and have done that for about 2 years now, love the job and have no plans to change my job, even though i get to see some horrible things, i also get to save lives.  When im not working i like to spend time with my family, browse reddit (of course), and whenever i get some time for myself, it's game time in my man cave. I played a lot of counter-strike in my teen years, age 12-15, but school, sports, friends and girls made me forget cs and i stopped playing.  Then, about 2 years ago, some of my friends started playing Global Offensive and later asked if i wanted to play with them. "Why not, could be fun" i thought. I bought the game and started playing, and boy did i fall in love once again.  Here i am 2 years later, still playing, following pro games, discussing with other players and love it.  To be able to moderate on one of my favourite subs would be like icing on the top, and i feel i would get even more involved in the cs community.	13-18 months	I think it's a great community where people are generally nice and helpful, one of the better community subs i've seen on reddit. Users get to share their thoughts and experiences from a game they love, and discuss with others who fel the same way.
5/31/2015 12:23:38	http://reddit.com/u/acecle	UTC+0	16	Yes!  I do web dev as a hobby, so I'm experienced in HTML and CSS, know basic javascript, and also currently learning PHP. I study computing in school and looking to go into coding as a career option, so I'm open to learning anything new that the role requires! 	Sadly not. 	Community night seems like a good concept to me. I haven't participated in one myself so I don't know the general procedure of the night. I feel the community nights would only be good if the skill levels are balanced, to make enjoyable games for everyone, so newer players (such as myself) wouldn't feel bad for not doing as well as more experienced players. I also feel they would be a good opportunity for newer players to learn from more experienced players, by having matches where there are coaches and new players.  	I feel that Newbie Thursday, like Community Night, is a good concept, but would only benefit people if heavily moderated, disallowing arguments/flaming and encouraging helpful discussions, which I believe already happens.   	Hi there!  I'm Acecle, a British 16 year old (17 in mid June) student currently studying for my A levels. With my exams soon to be over, I'm going to have a lot of free time, and would love the opportunity to moderate the Global Offensive subreddit. So without being biased towards myself, here are my pros and cons and why I feel I should be considered for the role.   Pros:  - I speak my mind: I like to say what I think on a situation, however I like to think about what I'm going to say before I say it, hopefully to prevent upsetting people.  - Opinions are Opinions: People are allowed to have opinions, and I won't be biased based on my own.  - Two monitors: I'm not a busy person as I'm just finishing my exams for the year, and two monitors allows me to have the subreddit up on my second monitor while I'm playing games and watching streams.  - Coding skills: As I said above, I enjoy coding/programming and I hope (with a bit of learning) to be able to assist in anything being worked on.  - Hardworking and Attentive to Detail: I enjoy putting detail into things (as you can probably tell by my application), and I am a hardworking individual for the things I enjoy doing.  - Not looking to take advantage of the role: I am not affiliated with any company and do not wish to use the role to gain anything for myself, I am doing this purely because I enjoy this kind of thing and I wish to be involved more in the CS:GO community.   Cons:  - I'm a lurker: I've been on Reddit a while, however I have never posted or commented in /r/GlobalOffensive, and I rarely post/comment on any subreddit. I hope this isn't too much of an issue, as I believe i'm still suitable for the roles due to my other perks.  - Fairly new to the scene: I come from a primarily TF2 background, playing multiple seasons of competitive TF2, however I only started playing casual CS:GO in late 2014, and only began taking competitive a bit more seriously in February/March 2015, so I am fairly new to the scene. However, I am open to learning, and spend much of my time either playing or watching CS:GO twitch streams.  - Lack of moderation experience: Other than moderating a fairly successful pro TF2 players stream, I have no prior experience in moderating. However, as said before, I am open to learning, and believe my determination and attention to detail still gives me the skills needed to moderate the subreddit.   Thanks for reading this, and sorry for the wall of text. I may not have the same experience in CS:GO as others, however I hope my pros convince you enough that I have the skills necessary to not only moderate the subreddit, but hopefully improve it in some way.   Thanks,  Acecle	4-6 months	Being a newer member of the community, I feel that overall, most people that post are usually helpful or looking to give you a laugh, however I'm sure there are less nice people that I never see due to the moderation that takes place, which is a good thing.

It does not affect me since I currently reside in Singapore which is far from both EU and NA. I prefer not to participate since the timezone difference will be an issue and ping will be very high (200+)	It is very helpful! I asked multiple questions there back when I just started following the competitive scene.	I was born in Indonesia but not a native. I can speak 4 languages (Indonesian, English, Chinese, and Hokkian [More like a dialect] ). In addition, I can speak english in several accents. I am 18 turning 19 in 2 weeks. I did not finish high school as I was sent to a university overseas. I currently reside in Singapore. I am taking a Bachelor in Information Technology in my university and I will be graduating next year and start working. I love watching streams and yes i'm a pleb. I mostly lurk on different subreddits and I can say that I am the most active on /r/GlobalOffensive. I love reading comments of people especially if it's drama about pro teams :D. 	7-9 months	The best community of CSGO no doubt. I have encountered several toxic redditors but the community of this subreddit is incredible. Furthermore, it needs more fluff!
5/31/2015 12:31:28	http://reddit.com/u/Nemnemm	UTC-6	18	I have taken classes in Highschool that taught me JavaScript and also HTML.	I do not have any experience admining a CS:GO server but idk have experience running other servers such as DayZ and Arms 3 servers these were mostly epoch and wasteland servers that were moderately popular 15+ players daily.	I think it is a great way for the community to play together I personally have not taken part in community night but have hears good things about it.	I think that Newbie Thursdays are a great way for people to find their way around the subrredit, I have personally used this to find the recruitment subreddit and also the adopt a silver subreddit!	I am an 18 yearold who has been playing counterstrike for about a year now. I go on this subreddit everyday to just browse and read many different posts, while I do not post much I pay a lot of attention to this subreddit. I spend atleast and hour and half a day on this subreddit. I am a supreme master first class in csgo so I do have knowledge of the game and also have knowledge about the subreddit rules. Thanks for considering me -Jimmy	4-6 months	I think that the global offensive community is very helpful in that they always seem to help people with problems/questions even if they are questions that have been asked before I personally have received help from people and it has been nothing but positive responses in my experience.
5/31/2015 20:01:28	http://reddit.com/u/glazbee	GMT-0	18	One of my two jobs is as a PHP Back end developer, though through my three years of experience I have accumulated HTML, CSS, JS and C knowledge too. I've worked with several small real-world companies in my area.   I've audited an IT companies network, helping the full-time developer optimize their network over a four week period during my college studies. I've worked with an independent comic book store to digitalize all of their items and provide a beautiful store front and I'm currently working with a local bar to introduce online bookings and launch them into the digital age.   In my spare time I also create my own webapps. I currently own two Steam bots programmed from the ground up. One, a 1:1 card trader (As in, same amount of cards, not 1:2 etc) and the other is a simple bot which will reply "Hello I am [steamusername]" each time it receives a message.   Finally, I have created several programs in a .NET and C++ environment for college, the most notable being a finance manager. You feed it your current salary, your location and the amount of people in your family and the program will tell you how much you should realistically spend on rent, groceries and other things. From my two case studies, it works. It still needs a lot more tests done though. It does this by searching three databases provided by UK organisations based on house prices, average bills and commute time. I'd like to make it more accurate, but I feel this would be impossible without some way to automate bank data, and there is currently no way to allow users to many of the major banks from an external source  EDIT: Fixed some grammar issues, made the post more generalized and removed company names. Will re-add if asked to.	I managed my own CSGO server for my college friends during a two year period hosted on Linode. I had to set the entire server up myself, and it used the following mods;   Mani Admin  Gun Game (v4?)  KZTimer  Skin Chooser  A few more   I also was in the market of creating my own mod, but with work and college both piling up I decided against it, as it would probably take too much time to create with other responsibilities I had to worry about.    I have also managed Gary's Mod, Minecraft, Team Fortress 2 and a Battlefield 4 server.	I think it's a brilliant idea to downscale such a large community into several subset communities of friends who can regularly play together. It would obviously be nice if the subreddit could have a global community night, but it just isn't feasible with NA to EU ping.    The 10-man games are also a great idea, though there aren't very many servers for the huge scale of the subreddit. I would be happy to allow the subreddit to use some of my server bandwidth (London-UK) for an extra 3-4 servers.   Also, I feel there could be an automated service which x amount of users can enter the game night, it will automatically sort them into y servers and the servers will be turned on/off before and after the community night. This wont be too hard to implement, and I wouldn't mind lending a hand to do it.	I've never really been involved to any capacity with Newbie Thursday, I have no opinions on it.	I'm 18 working two part-time jobs. One flipping burgers (Consistent income) and one working on the back-end of websites (Semi-consistent income). I'm currently not in college or university, I'm taking a gap year to save up for my first year of university at Cardiff starting September this year, where I will be studying Networking and Security.   I play a lot of CSGO, and I have two Steam accounts. One, which I created over four years ago and I gave to my friend after he built a PC (He didn't believe PC gaming was cheaper than console gaming) which had a value of close to £4000 including CS skins and games. The other, I play quite a bit of CS on though I'm kind of inbetween computers at the moment. My Z87 machine blew up (Literally, not figuratively) after the CPU cooler failed on me in the middle of the night, so I'm currently building an X99 PC which I hope to have finished by the 5th of June.   Beyond CS, I play a lot of Besiege, Kerbal Space Program and Team Fortress 2 with friends from work and college. I love games in general, and everything computer related is my full time hobby (Don't tell my mum, but the PC I'm building now cost more than my first car) and I have no problem dropping x amount of money for the latest 5960x. I spent very little money elsewhere, other than in CS, and I don't see much of a problem with spending big bucks on your hobby.	4-6 months	Over the six months I've had a Reddit account (And the year or so before) I've been an active lurker of GlobalOffensive. In that time, I've seen a lot more fluff appear over genuine posts, though I can't criticize a large community for upvoting fluff, if that's what /r/GlobalOffensive wants to see, then let them see it.   I think /r/GlobalOffensive could serve as an ambassador for Counter-Strike on behalf of Reddit, but I strongly disagree with the way other CS related subreddits are being run (For example, /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade). Whilst I understand these subreddits have nothing to do with yours, I do however feel somebody with potentially less knowledge of how Reddit works may make such a correlation. I feel GOT should not be linked in the sidebar, in favour for perhaps a curated subreddit ran by the GlobalOffensive guys, and I'd definitely be happy to help/moderate that subreddit too.   Also, I can't praise the moderator team enough for not officially endorsing gambling/betting. There are younger audiences who view the subreddit, and betting is the very last thing these audiences should be introduced to.
5/31/2015 12:47:41	https://www.reddit.com/user/NeverGamzee/	UTC+0	16	Not really, I tried and honestly failed! =)	Yes, I have been an admin on a few TF2 servers and Owned my own CS:GO server which i used for the retakes plugin. It was hosted by a friend of mine with a server. I just made sure the servers community was clean.	I suppose it's a bit of a fun way for the community to get to know each other! 	It's a nice way for more experienced player to express to less experienced players some tips and tricks to become better.	I have been looking on the Cs go Reddit for quite a while, however, i have not had an account because i suppose i never really came round to making one. I'm generally a nice guy, Currently Eagle (Time of writing this) on CS Go over 1k hours. Generally a PC gamer, I have NEVER cheated on any games. I have been giving tips to less experienced players i meet on community servers for a while now. I suppose I'm not a wordy person but, i did try to be as wordy as possible! =)	0-3 months	It's a very mixed community with nice and i suppose not so nice people. Some people are generally really helpful, others joke a bit too much. But in general it's fine! =)
5/31/2015 12:53:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheSmartiePantz/	GMT+1	15	Well, not really. I don't want to big myself up or anything, however, I have coded a few websites, I understand its not the really the hardest of things to do, however I've used basic (and I stress basic) HTML to code a few websites for servers I have played on, specifically a few CS 1.6 ones and Minecraft (I still play that). As far as the others go, I'm familiar with Java as most of the games I used to play when I was younger were coded in it. I also had a go at coding some mods for games, most notably Minecraft. These included custom clients and plugins. I can spot mistakes in Java, and correct them if needed. Finally, I'm learning Python as we speak in school, so hopefully, I'll be able to grow and develop my knowledge of that coding software and see what I can do in the future.	Well, everywhere I go, I've always been one to be mature and apply and offer myself up for positions of responsibility amongst the community. Thus, saying that, I recently was a server moderator of a various chain of 'Bunny-Hop' and 'Death-match' servers in CSGO. These were hosted by a long chain of companies, I think at one point there were up to 11 servers in which I held a position of responsibility on. I enjoyed my time here, as I learnt to develop communicational skills within the community, and develop a basic understanding of how to deal with players that have outstepped the limits of acceptable decorum. This included giving timeouts, bans and mutes all to server policy, and this helped me get where I am today as I can effectively change how I see players in conjunction with whatever the server (or in this case sub-reddit) sees fit. This of course would be something I would have to learn. Outside of CS in general, I own a few Garry's Mod servers in which I run, and have like previously mentioned been part of an administrative team on a very successful Minecraft server that ran for best part of 3 years. In general, I enjoy being in a position of responsibility over a community, as I feel this allows me to bond with the community. I think of myself as a reliable person that anything can come to with an issues, and I will deal with it in an appropriate manner.	As a long time lurker here on this particular sub-reddit  I have seen the noticeable green stickied thread on the top of r/globaloffensive quite a lot, almost every week in fact. The community play nights, in my eyes is a wonderful idea that allows people from all aspects of the community to play 5v5's on classic maps and even better get to try some new maps in development whilst play-testing. Personally, I do think this is a good idea, as not only does it allow people to play in non-competitive games, but it also makes the community... lets say less 'offensive' (keep this between you and me :D) In my eyes, these nights take some of the notable 'edge' of certain members of the community meaning that the sub-reddit in general if kept nice and cleaner for longer. One thing I would say, being an EU player is that many of these community nights don't favour us, at least the play-testings don't. If I received this role, I would try and influence the organisers to make a community night that favours all timezones, and also spreads the means of communication (i.e  Mumble) further or example to TS3 or Skype or whatever to suit others in the community.	Ah, Noobie Thursday, probably one of my favourite things about r/globaloffensive. It all started around 2 years ago, when I first found this reddit after been notified by a friend that 'CSGO' was a game that I totally should get. I think that Noobie Thursday is a great idea as lets face it, at one time or another, we were all noobs. It is a great way for people who are not so familiar with the game or even the sub-reddit to ask questions and get answers from more experienced members of the community. This idea, is one that I think should be spread more evenly throughout more games, and the camaraderie shown is probably why this sub-reddit has grown exponentially over the past few months. What I would do if I had the opportunity to would be to make sure that anyone (and lets be honest, people do troll) that is rude or offensive or a troll to a new member of the community is dealt with. Also, the term 'Noobie Thursday' never really appeals to me. It feels like we are criticising people for being new, perhaps a name change is in place to something more subtle, but still in with the common trends of reddit.	Alright. Well, my name is Calvin, I'm a long time lurker, and I am 15 years old, although I'd like to think I'm mature for my age. I live on a small island called Jersey (not New Jersey ;o) off the coast of France. We abide by english laws, and speak english although I have a good grip of French and Spanish (le baguette au fromage - Cally = KennyS confirmed) I go to school like most people my age, and are predicted straight A's in my final exams which I hope to achieve. As far as video games go, I've always had a deep love for them. Starting off with Spyro on my Gameboy 2000, Ive always had a deep love of games. As far as CS goes, I'm in a league team, we play ESEA and CEVO (cethrow) and I hope to get better in the long run  If always considered myself a leader, and I hope that on the sub-reddit I can continue that as well. I have been a long time lurker, but I do believe I can contribute skills such as effectiveness, good communication and a willingness to learn to the community. I hope that you have enjoyed your time reading this, and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future  Kind Regards -Cal Calvin Moderator (HLTV.org) confirmed! Jk	13-18 months	What can I say. Let me just refresh the r/globaloffensive page and tell you what I see regarding the community. -Refreshes- Primarily, I see a great range of people who are willing to commit their ideas and artwork and short gifs and so on to a community of people who all love the game. After all, its our common thing we have. I see people, who commit to the community, asking for help of tips or ideas, or even just having a laugh. I see people who want to improve their game and people who just point out things that make me smile. And this is why I have r/globaloffensive as a default page that opens when I boot my PC. On the whole, anyone I have interacted with has been kind and friendly, and I feel like this sub-reddit is a place for people who adore CSGO come to hang out as one big family. Of course, the moderators that have been chosen are doing a fantastic job, I'm clearly not going to critisise anyone, however I do feel that trolls and people who are not here to contribute should be dealt with faster, this correlates to your need of more mods.
5/31/2015 13:12:37	http://reddit.com/user/mrdyl4n	GMT-7	15	C++ and lua. If this question is aimed toward CSS, I could do it if I had to, but if you are looking for someone that can do CSS, I can't help :(	I was an admin for a very large team fortress 2 server killstreak gaming: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/killstreakgaming  But the longer I was admin, the more I realized it was admined by a bunch of power hungry little kids, so I left  I was also admin for a semi-popular subreddit for a while /r/backtothefuture	I love the idea, I have not participated yet, but it looks quite fun	I like it, it is always great to have new players learn	I am not the most active csgo player ever, I play it along side team fortress 2, so it doesn't take up most of my time. I played are 400 hours on my main account and with ~80 comp wins I was still a silver 3. I got fed up and started playing tf2. My other friend who used to play tf2 switched over with me, but then got pulled back into cs. I decided to join him, but by then my love for tf2 had grown, and I couldn't leave. Now my gaming time is about 50% tf2, 40% csgo, and 10% other games.	10-12 months	I am more of a lurker on this subreddit (honestly I'm not sure why). But it hasn't had any drastic changes in a while (community wise) most people are very nice, but as usual there is always that -17 points mge criticizing everyones strats. I honestly wish the community focused a bit less on pro players and more on questions, and gameplay gifs, but I don't really care
5/31/2015 13:23:24	http://www.reddit.com/user/Stormform/	UTC+2	18	I have some knowledge in HTML and a little bit of knowledge in CSS. So while I know a little bit, I wouldn't be useful in the actual coding of the CSS for the sub, other than for looking over for errors.	I don't have any real experience in cs:go moderation. Most of my experience in admining and moderating comes from the now quite irrelevant and died down message boards and forums, along with med sized minecraft servers (which I wouldn't hold to much value). Although with around 6 years of experience, I have seen a lot of different things, and adapting has never been hard for me.	The community nights are a great way to bring people in this sub together, and while I've noticed they are largely filled with regulars, any new face is often welcomed and and new friendships are born every time. Even though the games themselves might not be the most impressive, having the community together bonding is a great experience for everyone involved.	While I have never really participated in the Newbie Thursday things, I generally feel that is a nice thing to have, albeit not being involved leaves me with no real knowledge of how useful it is. I think that encouraging newbies to learn with the veterans is good, but I'm not sure how many newbies would be on this subreddit.	Hello, my name is Juuso, although I'm more commonly known online as Stormform. I'm a 18-year-old student from Finland. As I person I wouldn't consider myself anything special, although the past 8 years of my life, practically all of my spare time has been spent online, as a result of somewhat lenient parents and a decent enough computer. I've been a reddit user for the past 3 years, although I've been involved in different gaming communities and message boards for a longer time, ranging from minecraft servers to a gaming forum with 5k daily posts where I was (and am) an admin on. I've only been apart of the Counter-Strike community actively for about an year, excluding a brief stint of CS 1.6 years ago. I originally got into the CS:GO scene because of my passion for eSports that developed during my years of playing League of Legends and following its eSports scene, and that has lead to my active passion for the cs:go eSports scene and what could be called an addiction to watching and following it. Interestingly enough (my friends call me weird for this), despite my addiction to eSports, I've not developed any desire or need to bet on eSports, which is good because I end up spending my extra money on keys and skins anyway.  As for me as a person and a moderator, I'm usually quite lighthearted, and can be lenient at times, but I try to keep a consistent line with the rest of the moderation team. Other than that, my rank is gold nova 3, although I pretty much exclusively play faceit. 	7-9 months	I feel that during my time on this sub, and when I've gotten more involved over the past year, I've noticed the quick growth of our community, and the subsequent increase in trolls and other rulebreakers, however, I've also noticed how well the community regulates itself. Browsing other subreddits, I've noticed the difference and I'm quite proud of us as a community. Rarely do I see a community where everyone can usually feel welcome and can get involved even with how large of a community we are. One thing I'm very happy to see is how well involved the mods are in the community, something I rarely see in any bigger subs, and although there are less liked mods too, the general consensus has long seemed to be that the mods are very liked, and appreciated.
5/31/2015 13:25:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/CodePerfect/	GMT+8	18	I have experience in HTML, CSS, C++ and JAVA. I do not consider myself as an expert in programming but I do consider myself as a newbie programmer. I am currently studying in Game Programming so I it is related to programming.	Nope, I do not have any experience in admining servers.	NIL	NIL	I consider myself as a helpful, kind, patient, determine and cheerful person who loves to help people when they are in need of help. I would try my very best to help people out with their problems and would not give up until the problem is solved. I like how it feeling of helping people as it makes me happy. That may be the reason why I love helping people. 	0-3 months	I think that /r/GlobalOffensive community is rather active and friendly. People do not stop sharing funny stuff on the reddit and also help one another by giving useful tips so that they can improve on their skills. So I think that the community is a really nice place to be in.

5/31/2015 14:09:28	http://www.reddit.com/user/Rage_quitter_98	UTC+1	17	I used to create games using Gamemaker, it uses an custom coding language called GML (Game Maker Language)  Also i had some HTML in school although im not very good with it.  However to be honest most Coding languages are easy to edit once you know how you have to read them and also most problems can be fixed by using Google or other help such as books.  However i mostly edited Game configuations when i was new to Coding so yeah.	Sadly i never hosted any server, although i once had a friend who let me Moderate the server so i know some console commands.  However i hosted multiple Server for a game called Minecraft and sometimes i hosted Servers for GTA San Andreas (MTA:SA and SAMP if i remember correctly.)	The Community Night is an great opportunity to play a fun game with randoms you never met before. Also its a great way to play a MM like game without losing a Rank.  Also the Community Nights are good to meet new people, i already have 3 People added from previous community nights and since then we always play MM when we're bored.	Its a great way of asking newbie questions of course. Also its nice to ask a question without being bashed into the ground for asking a "silly" question.  Also most FAQ's also get answered simple and on the point.	Im a 17 year old Guy from Germany and i live in the beautiful city Berlin ,Rahnsdorf.  I play on the Computer since im 11 and the first Counter strike i ever played was 1.6 back when i was young, however i started on the SNES before i got into Computer Gaming. My childhood therefore consited of Super Mario and later Pokemon when i got a Gameboy Color with Pokemon Silver.  I got born 1997 in Köpenick (Berlin) and my birthday is the 9th of august and my style choice is really simple, i don't really care about what clothes i wear (as long as they're comfy.)  Im more of a quiet and shy guy. (thats also probably why im Single haha!) Also i don't like to have too many people around me when im outside thats why i only have 7 best friends. Also im really friendly and im careful around other people.  I consume pretty unhealthy stuff (mostly Chips and Energy Drinks) However i maintain my weight by doing Sports.  My Name (Rage_quitter_98) is an old piece of my childhood. i used to rage pretty badly and often "rage-quit" (however i don't do that anymore) but i still keep the name for nostalgia of my young days. the 98 stands for 9.8 (my birthday date) its as simple as that.  I am a PC enthusiast so i really often help people when they have a problem with thier PC or PC Software. (although i fix most problems by using Google or simply turning stuff on and off (yeah really.))  I live in a Big Forest so i don't have any neighbors and therefore it's really quiet but also cold in the winter.  Currently im about to finish shool and im currently looking into getting a good job that i like.  I would like to get a Job in the area of Graphic design, i create a lot of Graphics for example Tilesets in games to a complete redesign of a Game.  To be honest i was kind of lazy the last 2 years at shool however i quickly realized that i need to do something if i want to get a good job so i really had to improve a lot in the last year.  My english is pretty fine mostly although i struggle with speaking some complicated words out. also i sometimes forget to put asthrophes.  To be honest i love to talk in english more than in German.  I learned English in 4th class already but i have to say that i got most english excercise by playing games in english instead of german (also i mostly did it because german voices sound horrible in games compared to english ones.)  Im currently Gold Nova 2 in CSGO and started playing since operation phoenix and im currently at 566 hours. When i started playing the game i was pretty bad (and i mean REALLY bad) cause i was used to Call of Duty and Free to play FPS Games which play really differently.  I learned most stuff from visiting the Subreddit and by asking questions and by getting Friends who play with me. I Try my best to be positive in CSGO by supporting my Team with friendly words and advice.  I also love playing MM as it is the most fun/hard mode to play. Also winning always feels more rewarding than in other games.  I mostly post/lurk on Reddit as entertaiment, i love discussing things with people who share the same interest as i do although i don't really post stuff. just rarely when i want to show other people stuff i made in games for example or when i need help.  Whenever i can i also help people either by searching for answers using Google (and to be honest most people never even try this or else they wouldn't run into a problem.) or knowing how to solve the certain problem myself.  I visit this Subreddit daily (except when im sick or i have work to do) to get new Informations or see new silly things or to find out about updates. When im on Reddit i mostly lurk any kind of Post. Let it be new or popular.  My main way of communicating is by using Skype,Teamspeak or Mumble.   I would like to help by Moderating the subreddit by removing rule breaking stuff for example but also to help People as much as i can, also if other moderators want to play a round of CSGO im all in for it. :)  Yeah thats pretty much everything. i hope my wall of Text isn't too long and hard to read. Have a nice day. :)   	4-6 months	The Community is very friendly and also friendly to silvers/new players. (although a silver joke here and there doesn't hurt anyone.)  Most people also nicely discuss CSGO related themes or some even make funny jokes/puns that give some variety to the sub.  The community is pretty active and the same applies to the Moderators.  Also i like the moderators sense of humor, most moderators of other subs are way to strict.

Currently studying computer science at school, modding games really does intrigue me, I used to make basic mods for minecraft as well as custom maps or just coding in the game itself, it's something that really intrigues me. 	I was a moderator for a small CS:GO community server, it was quite active too.  A lot of Admin experience when I used to play minecraft, was an admin on one of the greatest servers.	Community night like an event that many people love and are eager to participate it, and infact, they are.  It is very enjoyable and relaxing, one of the best events for a gaming community. 	Newbie thursday was super helpful when I first started playing CS:GO, and I know it is quite useful to other new players too, it was also to my friends when I introduced them to /r/GlobalOffensive	I love CS:GO, but even more than that, I love CS:GO players, the community, their spirit, their humor, it's one of the best feelings to be playing around with them all and just having so much fun, I always love lightening up the mood in matchmaking, lightening up everyone's mood. Whether it's that typical Russian guy swearing at our whole team, or the little American kid letting me know about his amazing skin collection, I absolutely love interacting with the players more than the game itself.	13-18 months	This community....  oh boy, I love it, almost everyone here is so friendly and they never fail to amuse me, in my honest opinion, it is the best online community I have been a part of.
5/31/2015 14:32:18	http://www.reddit.com/user/lucriox	GMT+7	17	Nope :/ sorry	Yes, I know this is actually kind of lame but I used to be really into minecraft and i got pretty good at being admin/mod. I know how to balance being strict with a bit easy going. I understand not every person is gonna like me but I will follow the rules and enforce them.	I love it, I spend time on /r/leagueoflegends and they don't do anything like this and that is why I like how cs go isn't quite as big because we can have things like community night!!	Its good because it gives some experienced players a chance to share their knowledge and the new players a chance to learn, It also encourages the growth of the subreddit to invite new players!	Ya boy has played cs go for a little over a year i belive. Im nova 4 hopefully AK soon! about 230 wins so probably 500 games played!!! I got into pc gaming in around 2013, before that i was into Halo/Cod. I would play Xbox all the time!!! I started to play cs go and was instantly hooked!! It was so different from call of duty and halo but the same at the same time. It had the shooter feel but so much more skill!!! I love people and talking and I really think i'd be a great member to the Moderator team! Thanks and GL :D	10-12 months	Pretty tame, Don't see much hate and the creativity is expanding, i've been seeing a lot of fan art lately and i like it!!!
5/31/2015 14:46:09	http://www.reddit.com/user/kkoss/	GMT-4	23	Java HTML	I am an admin in all the ABM Community Servers(4 of them) and the Gaming Allstars Surf server.	I have only been to one Community Night.  I had a lot of fun but have not had the chance to do attend again.	I do not know much about Newbie Thursday at all.	I am a 23 year old college student who has played counter strike since CS 1.5 .  When most people switched to source I continued to play 1.6 for about a year before retiring, then coming back for CSGO.  I currently have 3k hours in game and I am a Global Elite. 	2-3 years	I feel like /r/GlobalOffensive has changed drastically.  When it first started it was as bunch of theory crafting about the game and how to make it better.  Now it seems like everyone just wants to bitch about one thing or another that they dislike about the game. Never about something good that  the devs have implemented.
5/31/2015 14:50:47	http://www.reddit.com/user/jokerr77/	GMT-4	15	I have quite a bit of experience in python from computer science class, and a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript. I'm able to learn more into any of languages if required. Here is an example of my work for a project with a friend in Python. http://pastebin.com/DM6JpE7g	I am currently a customer support admin for FaceIt.com I have experience in customer support (duh), and communication with players. I also have experience managing the PUG and point tournament servers using our own backend FaceIt Bot (which used to be EBot). The servers were running a competitive 5v5 config, with 1:45 round time and 35 sec bomb, etc.	Haven't participated but from the overview on how it works, it seems like a really great way yo bring the community and players together, while helping new players and those who want to improve :)	Even as a Gold Nova 3 (which isn't that high), I've learned a lot from reading Newbie Thursday, and I've contributed a few answers myself to help some of the lower players improve. I personally love reading the Newbie Thursday threads in case there's anything I don't know or anything I can contribute to any other people's questions.	I understand that there might be a conflict of interest since I'm an admin for FaceIt.com, but I can promise you that no matter what, I will always be and continue to be unbiased in any decisions that are made. I also understand that I will probably not be picked due to this possible issue.  Anyhow, currently I'm a highschool student in the 10th grade. I really love playing hockey and other sports. I think that I'd be a good fit for the moderators at /r/globaloffensive because I'm mature and able to deal with issues effective and efficiently. I'm also unbiased and not swayed when making a decision. I have some experience moderating subreddit such as /r/paydaybuilds, which is  small community dedicated to helping players make skill tree builds and other skills in the game Payday 2. I am on reddit fairly frequently, so I can deal with things such as the modqueue or respond to modmail if needed. I'm also fluent in English, and able to communicate effectively with people on the subreddit. With my experience, I can be an effective moderator and assist users with any issues and other subreddit related tasks.   At school, I am an executive on school clubs, such as the World Vision club, and the school's network developer team, which runs a site in which school clubs, teams, etc are able to communicate to their members with, and allows teachers to use without having to use Facebook or other groups that could share personal information. With this experience I aim to be a great leader and set an example for everyone.  I've seen the amount of hardwork you guys put into this sub, and I want to lend a hand in easing the burden for you guys. I hope that I'll be able to make your days and everyone else's day that much better, no matter what.  I hope you guys consider me as a candidate, and thank you for reading my application! Have a good day/night :)	13-18 months	The community has been very helpful to me, in that I read a lot about the game and how to improve my skills to get better. Over the time I've been here I've seen changes that I like, such as more OC, discussions and other stuff. The only thing that bothers me is when the same ideas/suggestions or feedback is posted again and again, since many people see it, but I've noticed that it's been happening less and less nowadays, which is really good :)
5/31/2015 14:51:57	http://reddit.com/user/JollyDoctor	GMT-5	19	I'm a Software Engineering major, C++ is my strongsuit.	No experience being an admin on CSGO servers, however I used to admin large minecraft and gmod servers. (Don't Drop the Soap Prison-MC, Lifepunch-GMOD).	Haven't participated.	Same as above, I know what it is, but never felt inclined to join.	I'm 19, was born in Moscow, came over here, have been here for 15+ years, can speak perfect English and Russian. Past that, I'm just an engineering major at my local university and I love CSGO, been playing it for about a year and a half and it's replaced all the games in my life.	10-12 months	It's kept with the flow of the game itself, you guys handle spam threads well as well as those that have phishing links, and you seem to be very active in interacting with the CSGO community, which is something I'd like to do more often.
5/31/2015 15:02:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/quotingmc/	GMT+0	15	Not much, bit of Visual basic.	I used to host a minecraft server but I have very little experience in source game server hosting.	I have taken part in several and as a map maker love to play others maps and give feedback.	I used to submit questions but have since started to answer them as I have become fluent in the game.	I am relatively new to counter-strike and have only been playing for about 6 months but as with almost every game I pick up I love to learn everything about it. I am fairly confident in saying I can answer any question about the game along with all its trivia and I regularly watch pro games and know about all Tier 1 and 2 teams. I am currently studying for my GCSE's and I am focusing on Art and Computer Science as a dream of being a game artist.	4-6 months	I feel that generally only the best content reaches the front page all though the new thread is often sprawled with questions which are all identical. An example of this is the new operation bloodhound drop system and it would be great if some way the number of repeats could be limited by easily accessible and topical FAQs.
5/31/2015 15:04:56	http://reddit.com/user/XFR72	GMT+2	16	A little bit of HTML	I was admin of a Counter-Strike 1.6 server back in 2007.It was mostly used by our school during breaks.	I don't have any thoughts on Community Night.	It's good to see the community help out the newcomers in a way that is helpful for everybody regardless of played hours in the game so it's not exclusively for newbies. I think that is very good.	Well I'm not good about talking about myself.(Okay 2 about is too much but hey.You told me to be wordy:DD) So: I'm from Hungary and as I'd written already I'm 16 years old. I'm in 10 grade(Well it's almost summer so 10,5).I started playing CS when I was years old. We had a Counter-Strike installed on all the PCs in the IT room so we were having fun back then.I was one of 4 or 5 guys who didn't just play Counter.Strike in the breaks but at home as well.I was really good at it compared to others but I had more than 7000 hours as I played it EVERY day when I had time.That is roughly 116 days that I had played with it. Some of it was Surf, some GunGame and I had a little bit of Deathmatch too. Some say I wasted most of my time but I loved that game so much that I didn't care. Then in 2012 when CS:GO came out (Somehow I jumped over Source) I bought my first legal copy of a game. It was CS:GO and I've been playing with it since then. There was roughly 2 months when I didn't play with it but I've been in love with the new adaptation of Counter-Strike. I'm a little good at it.Maybe average but I'm trying to improve and I'm practicing. I'm open minded with teammates and always try to win the match If possible. I can speak English well for someone my age with English beign a second language (although sometimes I even think with the language). I'm a straight A (or in my country a 5 since we use numerical grading) in English and IT.And I know a little German too. Currently I have about 1244 hours with CS:GO and I've won 520+ matches so I kinda know my way around things and I literally started from the bottom. Well thank you for reading through this and I guess that is all about me that I can think of.	0-3 months	I like the community like it is.Funny, helpful and most of all kind.Mostly... There are still people who flame but it's nice to see that there are not many of them and they are handled almost immediately.I have not talked to mods but it seems like they're doing a good job. I don't think that the community changed all that much considering they still want the same fixes from Valve and try to give the developers some idea. It's all the same for me as it was when I first came to /r/GlobalOffensive and honestly, I love it.
5/31/2015 15:04:58	http://www.reddit.com/user/Rud0lph	GMT-5	22	Java, PHP, HTML, CSS.		It's a pretty good platform to blend in with the community and know people to play MM/ESEA/CEVO/FaceIT with.	Sometimes I feel it's ignored by most of the community.   But its great a idea nonetheless.	Im a 22 Mexican student, Computer Systems Engineering, that likes to listen to all kind of music, play Tennis, soccer, videogames, basketball. Im sporty.   I currently am the president of the Student Council in my School and Im part of the Student Government. This is my last term though.   I would really like to be part of the moderator community in this sub. Im mostly active at night and when I have some free time at school.	10-12 months	I really like it, it has a wide variety of personalities and that's good. A variety of opinions/mindsets always brings up good stuff to the table and makes its enjoyable.
5/31/2015 15:14:59	http://www.reddit.com/user/dotpeenge/	GMT-8	19	I've learned a little HTML and Python, not too much, but it's something!	Yes, I've actually ran my own CS:GO, Gary's Mod, and VPS.	They're definitely great for testing maps out and sharing ideas with others who have similar interests.	I've personally never been to a Newbie Thursday, but it's great that we help other players out who just got introduced to the game.	My name is Gabe (and my last name starts with an N, no joke) and I'm currently going to school full time as a college student and have a lot of free time on my hands after school. I love CS:GO and it's probably the only game I currently play. I can't wait to see the community grow even more :)	13-18 months	It's pretty crazy how the community has grown ever since the majors started happening and I can see us growing for a couple more years (I'm sorry, but all video games do die unfortunately).  We are pretty amazing content creators though, I've seen so many funny, interesting, and educational posts, I can find myself scrolling through the subreddit for hours.
5/31/2015 15:18:01	http://www.reddit.com/user/Bleda412/	GMT-6	17	I have a little experience. I have done part of a Java Script class and have some knowledge of C++.	No, but I have moderated a guild spanning multiple games. I served as a forums moderator, made decisions, organized events, and publicized the community.	I think it's great to have a time when Counter Strike players can get together and play. Personally, I have had trouble finding a good place to play competitively or for fun with nice people.	I have checked it out a few times but have not asked questions. In the Hearthstone subreddit, I found the noob mega thread very helpful.	I like to play games. Esports is very important to me. I have written a few articles before, which I would like to be able to get better at and maybe make some money. I play both League and CS:GO, but I also enjoy the occasional single player game.	10-12 months	No BS here, I love the /r/GlobalOffensive community. I play League too, and this subreddit is so much better. Thankfully, this week the tyrannical mods have gone on vacation, and due to strong community efforts some have gone on a pseudo VACation. I think this subreddit is better than the average MM game, which is good, but some people that I get matched with really piss me off. If I were a moderator, I would follow the actions to keep out posts like "Vovlo fix AWP. Please like for Gaben," so that good ones like the one about Pasha's past financial struggles can be viewed.
5/31/2015 15:18:28	http://www.reddit.com/user/Zimmerdude	UTC-7	17	Yes, most familiar in Java and C#.	I have never been an admin on a CS:GO server, but I am currently a mod for a Gmod team, as well as Minecraft. I'll explain how both communities are run, but I shall start with Minecraft, as it is much more simple.  The community had 3 ranks when it came to admining. I was involved in training new recruits and a part of the team that does the majority of rule enforcing. It was a child friendly server, so being calm was a must. After almost two years of admining there I can say I have developed good negotiatiing and problem solving skills, as well as staying calm in heated conversations. I was not the highest rank either. The biggest thing about admining in that community though, was that even though you were higher than regular players, you were never meant to act as though you are above them, and they are below you.  The second one is for a community named HellsGamers. You may have heard of this community, as they are relatively notorious for their harsh rules, and the way they run their community. I moderated on a server that was a part of the Gmod division, specifically a roleplaying server, and there were a ton of rules for this particular server. This was an older crowd, so being calm and collected would get you trampled over. They taught me how to make people respect me and my authority, as my voice when I first started we very high(we were to engage in moderation via voice). As a result I can enforce rules by using my authority, all while keeping the situation under control. As a moderator, we were to enforce all the rules (50+), settle arguments between players, and although we didn't have direct banning power, we were able to request a ban via Skype, which was only used in major situations.  Sorry for the long read, and regarding the Gmod paragraph, I wrote it in past tense even though I am still a moderator as the server is currently dead.   Basically I have been in two very different communities, and have learnt a lot about dealing with people	I think it is a very good community building event. The pros outweigh the cons easily.	Once again, very good, as it welcomes new players into our community, and shows them we are not elitists.	I'm not going to be too personal, but rather explain a quirk or two about myself.   I'll preface this with the fact that I am a 17 year old graduating in one week. (Pretty much the only relevant information about myself)  I have been lurking on Reddit since 2012, and eventually made an account about a year and a half ago. I still do not comment much, as I rarely have anything to say, as it has either been said, or I want it answered myself. That being said, I am not afraid to comment, I am just conservative. I love debating with people, and resolving arguments, and not to boast or anything, but I have become pretty good at them. However, Reddit is not the place for me to do that currently. That brings me to why I want to become a moderator: I have seen, and considered entering the moderation application for other subreddits, but decided against it for many reasons, one being the fact that I didn't care for the subreddit that much. However, I love the CS:GO reddit, and I feel I can put my skills and experience towards helping something I love.  Thanks for taking the time to read my long application.  - Zimmerdude	19-24 months	I think it is one of the best game related communities out there. People aren't concerned about your rank or skill level, as everyone is here because we love CS:GO. The posts are always great, whether it is informational, or discussion. It's always the first place I check regarding CS:GO news. I have learned a lot about CS:GO from this subreddit alone.  As for the current moderators, the only people that would have a beef with them are the ones who have had their post taken down, which is a terrible reason. I rarely ever agree with anyone who complains about the moderation or community here.
5/31/2015 15:19:44	http://www.reddit.com/user/BOTY123	GMT+2	15	I have a tiny bit of experience coding, but i can not really write any code. I am able to read it, and tell what it does most of the time.	None.	While i have never participated, i think that it is a very fun idea, and it helps socialize with the CS:GO community.	I have asked and answered a few questions in Newbie Thursday threads, I think they are great.	I am a 15 year old guy, i like to play CS:GO (of course :) ), i currently moderate a few subreddits, some of them being: /r/interstellarmarines, /r/nonononoaww, /r/warthundermemes.	10-12 months	I enjoy the community, i check the subreddit 5+ times a day.
5/31/2015 15:22:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/Killamgoro/	GMT-4	18	Very very little, coded for an Arma 3 server once.	Yes, I have admin'd two Arma servers for over 3 months (combined) which had 80+ players, and also have admin'd for a bunch of small teamspeak's and Minecraft servers.	I love it, I have only been able to make it out two times but I think it's a great opportunity to meet new people.	Also think its a great thing, I've never actually posted in it, but whenever I check it out there's always good advice being given.	Unfortunately there isn't much to tell, I really only go to my classes come home  and play CS, I used to play sports but after being concussed in rugby two years in a row that stopped. 	10-12 months	Sometimes it can be great but more lately there have been more posts that have become popular that don't truly show what global offensive is, I 'm not quite sure what I'm trying to say but, it seems to be falling in quality in my opinion, still love the subreddit though.
5/31/2015 15:25:34	http://reddit.com/u/Moochoomon	GMT-5	14	HTML Javascript Java CSS	I was a trial moderator for a garry's mod server, however it shut down before i was promoted to an actual moderator.		I think it's great that we have a day dedicated to helping new players. It helps the community a great deal.	I'm a 14 year old guy who often plays video games and browses reddit on his free time.  I have a lot of free time and don't mind spending it playing with friends, helping others with their problems, or even messing around with various programming languages to see how the work. I have a strong sense of justice and my emotions don't get in the way of my judgement. I have 500+ hours in CS:GO and have dabbled in CS:SS. I am currently gold nova master.	4-6 months	The subreddit is decent, however I think it can be improved by more interaction that doesn't involve the same topics.
5/31/2015 15:33:45	http://www.reddit.com/user/SoldierBobMcBob/	GMT-5	15	I have done some HTML and CSS in school, but I do not have a massive amount of experience.	No	I love the idea, though I have not personally participated since I always end up seeing the posts after they have started.	I think Newbie Thursday is a great way for new players to learn some things about the game, and I wish I had known about it when I was a terrible silver player.	I am a 15 year old from New York, and I'm currently in high school. I love CS:GO, and it is pretty much the only game I actually play, despite all the other games I own on Steam. Most of my nights, and most weekends, are spent playing CS:GO. I am currently only nova 3 after some 200 comp wins, but I feel I am getting better, with significant help from tips and tutorials found on the subreddit and from Youtubers like the Warowl. I also watch a lot of pro games, primarily lans, but if I am really bored and just lost a bunch of comp games, I will watch some online games. My favorite team is Cloud9, but I will cheer for NiP when Cloud9 inevitably goes out in groups. I usually fill the leader role both in game and out of game when doing group activities. I enjoy organizing and coordinating plans, then seeing them come to fruition. I hope I will make a good mod for /r/globaloffensive.	4-6 months	I love the discussion of pro games and updates, and I think the sub is the best place to come to for information on those topics. The constant complaining posts on the same topics, though, can be annoying. For example, there seems to be a post once a week or so complaining about the tickrate, even though pretty much everyone in the community knows about the issue and does not need to be reminded. The occasional puns are fun as well.
5/31/2015 15:34:39	http://reddit.com/u/noxiqoid	UTC-5	17	I don't think a 5 minute intro to HTML coding counts...	I'm not quite sure if this counts, but I was admin for a server by the name of "VolantGaming," Right as CS:GO came out, all of the servers went down, so I guess maybe about 2 months of administrating on an actual CS:GO (surf) server.		I think it's a great way to ask widely unknown questions! Instead of asking someone you know or someone in game, then getting ridiculed after asking said question, you just get a quick answer.	I don't play CS:GO itself THAT much, as of 5/31/2015 I have 231 hours, but I love seeing what kind of entertainment the community has to offer. I find videos (like strat roulette) extremely funny, and that's why I've been subbed for around 10 months or so. This isn't quite something to be proud about, but I check Reddit for 3 or so hours at night, ranging from 10:00pm to 2:00am. I try not to comment unless absolutely necessary on /r/globaloffensive since I might get shot down for whatever reason. Thanks for looking through my application!	10-12 months	The current mods are fine. However, the CS:GO community is toxic. Oh so very bad. Well, not THAT bad, /r/leagueoflegends is 20x worse. For example, I posted a gfy of a friend of mine, who was DMG at the time (I was nova master), who had a bad gunfight, and I got a funny view of it. I posted it, and everyone suddenly started criticizing me. Comments like "Smurfs like you ruin the game," "your sensitivity is too high, that's how you died," and "the reason silvers can't level up is because of people like you." JUST because I titled the post "When I play with silvers," meant as an ironic joke since I was only a nova master. Well it's inevitable when a community gets over-popular. There are still a large amount of good people though.
5/31/2015 15:55:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/Harndaer/	GMT+3	20	I'm a Computer Science student right now and I'm more focused on software programming languages like C/java but I also have a little experience with PHP and JS.	I don't have experience in admining servers.	I like the idea of the community nights a lot but I always had something in my way (either promising friends, eating, falling asleep) so I couldn't participate in. 	I think it's nice giving oppurtinities to newbies to ask and learn about the game without facing trolls or angry high rank players.	Well, my name is Mervan (pronounced like Merouaan), I'm a college student in Ankara, Turkey. I love games and Counter Strike in particular. I used to escape from school and go to local internet cafes (not sure if thats the real name of it but i mean places with lots of computers and internet in it, basically a place that you pay for a limited time of surfing/playing games) with my friends and play CS 1.6. I skipped the Source because I was a kiddo who's afraid to ask for money from his parents to buy a video game. Then I moved on to CS.   I've been following reddit for almost 3 years now, but just signed up 7 months ago, because I wanted to be more active in subs like /r/leagueoflegends and /r/globaloffensive. I still check reddit almost every hour but I'm not a very talkative person in comments' section, I usually crack jokes or try to answer questions, if there is a question that I can answer.  I think I also have common sense and enough Reddit knowledge to act according to the rules. I also had some local forum/imageboard moderation jobs but most of the sites were relatively small and didn't have as many users and content as a sub like this, so I'm not actually sure if I can tell you that I have experience in modding :P.  Anyways, hope I haven't been too wordy, that's pretty much the summary of my CS/Reddit history. hope you find the right people for the job. Good luck and take care!  	4-6 months	I think it's a nice community. Not perfect for sure, it has its flaws and trolls, but there are also many many nice people who always manage to put a smile on my face. I think this sub's users are mostly in the better part of CS community, so that makes this sub an enjoyable place, at least for me.
5/31/2015 15:56:03	http://www.reddit.com/user/ROOKIE99/	GMT-4	16	Currently teaching myself, but besides that I do not have experience in coding. 	Never an admin in csgo servers, but I have been admins for TF2, Minecraft, and GMod servers as well as a captain of a CSGO team that just started. 	I believe it is a great way to communicate and have fun with the community	I believe it is a great way to let new players ask their questions in a safe environment where they do not need to worry about being judged. 	I'm a 16 year old Floridian that absolutely loves computers. I have met a lot of friends online across the 3 years I have been playing on PC. I started off playing TF2 and helping out community servers, I then progressed to GMod TTT servers helping out another friend with his servers as well as helping out a large GMod community called LooseCannon. I never became a staff member on LooseCannon, but a lot of the admins were my friends and I was their eyes in the sky when they weren't online. My love for computers lead me to start teaching myself coding, but ended due to life issues. I have become to start teaching myself it again, but has been halted by also learning how to animate. By the end of this month I will have about 6 months of learning how to animate. I then went to CS:S where me and the GMod admins would have fun, but my time there didn't last long as I moved to CS:GO. I am currently ranked GNM and main the AWP. I like to think of myself as a mature teenager, but I can be a bit self centered at times. PC gaming will always be my favorite and reddit will always be my favorite site!	4-6 months	I believe it can be, at times, too focused upon the rank of someone, but besides that I believe it is a funny, helpful, and kind community that still is still growing and needs to be a tad more accepting. 
5/31/2015 16:03:31	https://www.reddit.com/user/Koipe/	UTC+3	18	No	No	To be honest No idea what this is. :/	To be honest No idea what this is. :/ i guess we help newbies? I always want to help people!	Mostly spent my time on computer 6-12 hours playing CS:GO and browsing net, not much special	0-3 months	i've been browsing reddit for a while now. But registered only couple weeks ago.

Not only CS GO servers but other source games with admin'ing experience for years.	None.	I like Newbie Thursday. As we are growing into something big, we need people to help the new ones not to be shy and ask as many questions as they feel like!	My name is Steve "spiracy " Jackson. I'm always on /r/GlobalOffensive looking for interesting things to read,  improving at the game with my team, and also learning whats going on with the pro scene. I try my best to help others out in the best manner possible.  I have a lot of free time, I can always be on /r/GlobalOffensive for a few hours and even more sometimes.  I'll have MUCH more free time in june as I will not have school anymore so I can roam around reddit during that time :)  have a good day	7-9 months	My thoughts on /r/GlobalOffensive is just " amazing " Sure it has some problems and that's why moderators exist :) Not only do we care about ourselves, but other threads such as dota and tf2. 
5/31/2015 16:21:35	https://www.reddit.com/user/ScottishTyrant/	UTC+0	17	Very basic knowledge of HTML 5 looking to learn more thoroughly however.	Absolute piss all	I love testing out new maps as I like a variety of maps as a challenge to learn and test out. It also gives a good place with sensible feedback for map creators to test their maps.	This helped me learn a lot of the basics of CS:GO and also allows a place to not get mocked for asking certain questions that some may look down upon for asking. I think it is one of the best places to get advice and links to aid your CS:GO	I have only recently left the controller to play fps games and despite the large learning curve CS:GO is so satisfying to play and by far the best fps game I've played, Steve Jobs said 'Simplicity is the greatest sophistication' the perfect description of CS:GO. I'm currently GNM in the game with 99 wins and play with a group of mates in a small team we created. Outside of CS:GO I'm an avid fencer, cyclist and footballer. Big fan of the band Billy Talent (the better Canadian version of Green Day). Aiming to study physics at uni hopefully if I don't cock up my exams.	10-12 months	I think is one of the best gaming communities on Reddit and is very active and never feel intimidated and a lot of the posts are quite funny and witty while still being serious to a healthy extent.
5/31/2015 16:25:14	https://www.reddit.com/user/Muldvarpen/	GMT+1	20	i know pretty basic html but other than that not much, it's something I always wanted to learn properly but never had a goal to reach so it just faded away. 	Yes I have been hosting/admining on various servers since source, mostly private servers for practice etc that I have run on my own. Most of them I setup myself on either a local computer or a vps	Love them, only had the chance to participate once so far but it was a lot of fun.	Great resource for people new to the game, and some of it for us veterans too.	I'm 20 y/o from Porsgrunn, Telemark in Norway. RL friend with BrokN9. Currently studying as a apprentice electrician which I will be done with in january. Been playing cs since 2007 with some breaks in between. 	2-3 years	I am quite happy with the sub as is.
5/31/2015 16:36:48	https://www.reddit.com/user/ducttape815/	GMT-4	17	Very brief ammount of html,java and css although i am taking a intensive course on java this summer as well as AP computer science next year	I run a server that is used by me and maybe 10 other people i know to practice smokes and strats.	sounds like a great system although i have not personally participated in any myself although i plan to in the future.	I think it is a great idea to help new players as well as some more experienced to learn more about the game and grow as a player. One thing that i believe could be a good condition to this is adding a way for the poster of a comment to mark the best answer to make it easier to browse the thread.	I am currently a high school senior in New York and am a very active player and follower of the cs go community. I have been playing for over a year now and have been closely following the pro scene and forums for about 9 months.I play in cevo amateur and esea open and am a very dedicated player spending a large percentage of my days around CS. Outside of CS I am very passionate about technology and am planning on majoring in computer science or engineering in college. I am a very calm and reasonable person and do not make many rash or impulse decisions and rarely get angry.  	4-6 months	Overall i think the csgo reddit has a great overall community and for the most part has improved a lot recently. One change ive noticed over the last year(did not have an account until ~5 months ago but still followed the reddit) is a influx of new players to the game. I think it is great that the community is expanding however it sometime gives a different feel then having more experienced players. 
5/31/2015 16:42:54	https://www.reddit.com/user/thegregster101/	GMT+0	20	Generally very limit. 	Have been admin of Counter-Strike: Source servers in the past. Familiar with basic console commands. rcon etc. Have used filezilla to manage the server. Installed plugins. etc. 	Very good. It is hard for map creators to find people to test their maps. I know this all to well since I'm currently making a competitive map and it can be hard to get feedback.	Not sure what this is. 	I live and work at home on my families farm. In my spare time I play games, create videos and party ;) 	7-9 months	Great place. Without reddit none of my youtube videos would have taken off in the way they did. I have only the reddit community to thank for the exposure it has given me. 
5/31/2015 17:00:38	https://www.reddit.com/user/Paul11596/	UTC-4	18	took AP computer science in high school last year and learned JAVA some C++ and a little bit of python, I would need to brush up on all of these and I will also be attending college this fall for computer science	no	I have never participated but it sounds fun	It's a neat idea and I sometimes read those threads and learn new cool stuff	I'm a normal guy from new jersey about to attend college in the fall. I'm very passionate about counter strike and I visit this subreddit every day.	13-18 months	Little too much fluff and not enough e-sports discussion in my opinion. I like having a place to discuss the game though.
5/31/2015 17:06:13	https://www.reddit.com/user/TeamSiren/	UTC-6	20	I have experience in HTML, Javascript, CSS, and some PHP. I have done websites for several local businesses around my area, as well of some online gaming communities, who have shut down.  My old imgur: dotgg.imgur.com My old deviantart: http://dotgg.deviantart.com/  	I have owned several servers and also moderator on several community servers. Servers I was part of the administration team were part of the CS:S, CS:GO, and GMOD communities. 		It is a great learning experience.	I work at an automotive body shop and I love gaming. I do a bit of streaming, however I do not have good enough computer to stream what I really wanna stream. I love community interactions and entertaining people.	10-12 months	I have seen the good and the bad side of the subreddit. Overall the community is solid, although you get those few that show up nearly every day.
5/31/2015 17:09:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/AnttiStorm	GMT+3	15	Not yet.	I have not been an admin on a CS:GO server, BUT have some experience admining ArmA 3 servers.	I enjoy the Community nights. Well planned, great fun.	I think is it just great to have weekly posts where anyone can ask anything without getting flamed or trolled (the staff is doing a very good job deleting flamers and trolls out of this sub-reddit). I personally also think it brings the people of /r/GlobalOffensive closer to eachother.	I am a 15 year-old person from Finland. I spend most of my free time on my computer playing video games such as CS:GO, or kill some time at /r/GlobalOffensive on my phone.   I've played on the pc since 2011, when I bought my first gaming computer,  and soon after that Counter-Strike: Condition Zero from a GameStop (thinking about it now, I do not even know how in the world I managed to find a game so old from a GameStop). I was hooked. But my addiction disappeared after I bought Civilization V, and soon after when I bought it I discovered steam. Sadly, never touched the CS:CZ disc again. Bought CS:GO about 2 years ago.  I have a lot of free time when I could moderate the sub-reddit.  So, that is about it.  - Antti "AnttiStorm" B.	4-6 months	The sub-reddit is quite large, and I am actually amazed by the fact that the trolls and flamers are almost non-existent.
5/31/2015 17:12:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/Dreamytje/	GMT+1	20	I know basic HTML, Javascript and Python, nothing special. 	Back in CSS I hosted quite a popular server, had around 20 slots and would feature a variety of maps. Mostly surf maps, but also some fun maps on the side. We wanted to provide the players with the best experience. People liked to surf, but most would be bored of it after 2-3 maps. So we rotated some other types of maps in, like minigames etc.  I had to take an extended leave from CSS, but I kept the server running. However not investing much time in it, kind of made me run behind on updating it. Which led to people switching to other servers.  After CSS I became an admin for a huge COD4 community, it was called Netsky. They hosted about 12-16 servers, which would be filled all day long. I mostly did ingame admin work, spectating cheaters, keeping chat monitored etc.  	Community night is a lot of fun. Ive not gotten to attend too many of them, but Ive been to a couple. Its a good way to get away from everything and just have a laugh. Not really much more to say, some nights were better than others. 	I have not participated in this. But I do hear good stuff from it, so I guess that speaks for itself.	So, Im a 20 year old guy from The Netherlands. I study business economics, currently in the third year. Lets say I just ace my study so I have plenty of time on /r/GlobalOffensive in class ;)  Ive always been a person who wants to be of good use. Thats probably why I've been an Admin so often. Ive been GM (GameMaster) on WoW private servers, thats where it started actually. And I noticed how much fun I had not playing myself, but helping others and the community.   After WoW I had my own CSS server and became admin for a CoD4 community, like I stated about above.  I've also been a moderator for quite a big twitch streamer for about 2.5/3 years now. He used to be the number 1 Diablo 3 streamer, pulling 4-6K viewers. Nowadays he plays different games, which has an impact on the viewers but he enjoys it way more. After about 6 months I became the head moderator for his chat, so I had control of all the other moderators. Its good fun, but there's too much drama going on so I pulled back and I'm just a moderator now for the sake of being a friend.   I guess thats all, if there are any questions Id be happy to answer them!	10-12 months	When I started reading /r/GlovalOffensive I would just check the OP's post, and that would be it. But after a little while I started reading the comments as well, which gives you a whole different view of the community. The community changes with the game tho, but people will always be critical about changes. I spend about 3-4 hours reading through /r/GlobalOffensive every day, so you get some kind of connection with the more active users. You'll notice their comments on different topics and you get a general idea of their personality. And its quite fun, some people I'd love to drink a beer with.   I think that with CSGO growing so much, and that obviously having an impact on the reddit, we'll see another change in the community soon. Its gone from a smaller more tight userbase to quite a large userbase where there's way more opinions being thrown around. But I guess we'll see that when or if it happens. 
5/31/2015 17:20:51	http://www.reddit.com/user/Bodomi/	GMT+2	24		Yes I have experience with 'admining' servers, I've been an admin on a couple TF2 Unusual servers and I was an admin on the CSS Dfekt servers, they where the hugest Norwegian CSS servers butDfekt is no longer active.  I've also been an admin/officer for a couple World of Warcraft guilds and guild websites.  I have not been an admin of any CS:GO server but I have a lot of experience within being an admin of both game servers and websites.	I think it's pretty neat but I haven't attended any due to time zone	Don't really have any thoughts on Newbie Thursday, guess it's nice for the people who partake.	I'm a former huge TF2 Trader, at one point owning a $15.000 backpack in TF2.  I've been playing Counter-Strike for about 7-8 years, out of all CS games I think I played CSS for the longest amount of time, but I love CS:GO more than any other CS game. I've also been a mod for Sodapoppin but I quit that after 2 months due to not wanting to spend all my time in Sodapoppins chat and complications with another mod in Sodapoppins chat.  I live in Norway, currently unemployed but some of my jobs have been customer support for various Norwegian websites/companies.  When I was 16-19 years old I worked at the warehouse at Europris(a Norwegian general store) and at the Komplett.no warehouse(a huge website that sells products raging from dish washers to lawnmowers to computer stuff within Norway and Sweden).  I play a ton of games(explains why I have over 1000 games on Steam ;p), but overall, so far, my favourite games are Diablo 3, Team Fortress 2, CS:GO, Life is Strange, the GTA series and the Saints Row series.  Some other.. I guess fun facts?  My humour is that of Jake & Amir, if you don't know who they are just look it up on YouTube and you will find their web series. I used to be an item pricer on Backpack.tf but stopped that soon after I cashed out my TF2 backpack, now I only play TF2 a couple times a week doing MvM(Mann vs Machine, a TF2 co-op game mode).  I guess that's about it.. can't think of anything.  Have fun selecting mods!	0-3 months	It's a nice community and most people I've personally spoken with via /r/GlobalOffensive have all been nice people, but there are of course trolls and immature people out there but... usually I just don't count those people.. if 1 out of 50 people are an idiot then I count them as an outlier and not a part of the community.
5/31/2015 17:26:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/MySelfLuls	GMT+1	16	I have experience in HTML, CSS, Python and learning to program in C++	I have been hosting tempoary servers for quite a while, I am a part of a LAN team where we arrange CSGO tournaments, I set up the servers for the games. The servers was mostly used as 128 Tick competitive servers. 	I personally think it is a great idea, howerver I have yet to experience them myself (Mostly a reddit lurker, not really one who participates) 	I actually did learn a lot from Newbie Thursday and improved my gameplay, so I did really read up on the comment sections and I think its a great idea to keep the subreddit active.	First of, Hi! I’m Micklas 16 years old and from Denmark, currently educating myself at college preparing for the university. But I am mostly just known by my IGN MySelfLuls.  I’ve been playing since 2006 where I shared an account with my brother, around 1 year later I got my own  account (yay) and started playing CSS with a friend of mine, I played a TON of CSS back then. After a while I started getting hooked to Garry’s Mod and joined a friendly community, I was in that community for around 4 years until it shut down, back then I got in touch with the server administrator and he got me hooked on server-related stuff.  I was a member of this community for around 1 year when I became a Community Manager, I ran as CM until the end. Afterwards started playing many different games with my friends. I then got hooked on League of Legends, was hosting my own facebook page and started tournaments back then. So I do have a lot of contacts related to sponsors etc. Now, the Facebook page is mostly being managed by itself, meaning I have tons of time. During this period, I mostly browsed reddit, just lurking for around 2 years. Although Lately I started to post a little.  I am sorry for any grammatical mistakes, I am still improving my English and hope I could be of assistance. Best Regards, MySelfLuls 	7-9 months	I think the subreddit has changed a lot, personally I feel like it changed in a good way and it does feel way more professional now. The subreddit is so well moderated and I do not really see anything wrong with it (From a personal experience)  
5/31/2015 17:27:26	http://reddit.com/u/defyingtoitle	GMT-4	17	HTML, JavaScript, CSS	Not specifically CSGO servers, but I owned and admin'ed for a community of 25000 players on minecraft two years ago. 	N/A	N/A	Currently a 17 year old student, going into senior year of highschool. I'm planning on studying website development and aeronautical engineering in the future, so my course work is derived from that. On the outside I'm not much, a bit anti social, friendly, but on the inside I am able to read people like books. I always try to help people who are hurt, and it's very obvious to me what people are feeling about a situation.   I dont have a lot to say, because I dont have a lot of stories, but the one thing I will say is that I hope to work with you all in the future. Thanks.	4-6 months	I try to shy away from direct action about the community, but to put it bluntly its getting significantly worse. Yes, the player base is rising, but streamers playing aim to entertain the younger population, which significantly decreases maturity around here.   An interesting idea for the sub would be to remove most talks of betting websites, as anyone can easily get upset and emotional over a loss. Of course you could keep the announcements such as "Hey we just opened a new site", or "Stop using lounge, its been compromised", but most other talks should be removed
5/31/2015 17:30:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/Reborn4122/	GMT-4	15	Im looking to learn, but not at this time.	When i was a bit younger i moderated some Minecraft servers (Just small survival ones.) 	Im unfortunately not aware what Community night is. 	When i was new to the subreddit and CS:GO in general these threads helped a lot. Helped me to know what weapons to buy and when, where to go and do what. 	I don't really do much to be honest. I go to school. Come home, Play games. Sometimes i hang out with my girlfriend. At the time of writing this im going on a date with her in about an hour. I really like where i am in life, and next year im going to apply to go to a thing in my area which is basically a college level course for computer science, which means i will have college credits for wherever i want to go and i will be able to get a job out in the field right out of High School, which will be amazing! I'm Trying my hardest to get where i want to be in life, and im having a lot of fun doing it!	4-6 months	We have a very nice community here, and i love the way we all agree on somethings, and hate others together.
5/31/2015 17:36:04	http://www.reddit.com/u/ProfessorRetro	GMT-5	14	No.	I was an admin on a server called Hazardous Gaming that shut down a few days ago. It was a server that had a fairly large community, averaging 20 players a night. There were minigame maps on that server, and it was mainly a place where people could come and practice course maps. What I did there was help moderate the chat and such, cause there was a mix of older members and younger members, and such there were quite often arguments and disagreements, and just plain toxicity that I and the other admins did our best to resolve.	I think that it is a good idea that brings together the community, and it helps bring us all for some fun competitive times.	I think that it is a fun idea, and it's kind of joy inducing to see a community being brought together by the reminiscence and assisting of newer and less experienced members by the older and more experienced ones.	I am a 14 year old boy who turns 15 in September. I honestly am not that special, and I'm kind of just ordinary. I enjoy playing the game and I'm a MG2. I'm not going to bore you guys by saying or exaggerating a lot of traits about myself, but I put my passion into what I do, and I love helping others.	10-12 months	I honestly think that it is a good community, and whilst I do think that there are some toxic players, the staff does a decent job of moderating posts and such. However, I would love to see more of a presence by the moderators on posts and such. I know that they are busy with real life and whatever may come up, but it just looks a lot better on the staff team if people who are a part of the subreddit see them being a part of the community like any other person.
5/31/2015 17:52:05	https://www.reddit.com/user/bangaloresupreme/	GMT+2	20	Minimal css and html knowledge	No not at all	It's a nice way to get together people	It's also a very nice way to get less skilled players tips they need and also "coach" them, lead them in the right direction so to say	Hi! My name is Filip Ilic, I live in Stockholm, Sweden.  I've been making music for 8 years, been playing cs for 10, I write tracks for other people and I'm mostly on my computer all the time, I'm good with rules and I don't side with people regarding opinions if when I have to do my job. I have a girlfriend which I've been together with for 2 years now and life is good!	13-18 months	I love it but the shitposting can be a bit annoying sometimes
5/31/2015 18:06:05	http://www.reddit.com/user/JnKTechstuff/	GMT-4	18	Some JavaScript	Have been running a modded minecraft server network for over a year and a half. Have run Global Offense servers, GMOD servers, and ARMA 3 servers. I also own a powerful dedicated server box located in Kansas City	A cool community to hook up with other dedicated players. Also a great place to start a small team instead of solo queuing 	No thoughts other thank its Newbie Thursday. Haven't really partaken in it.	Well to start my name is Jake or JnKTechstuff I am an experienced Redditor I am 18 and I often go on the reddit and several others nearly every hour. I own 3 modded minecraft servers and have been running them for over a year and a half diagnosing problems and just providing a great service to a small but growing community. Before you say well they are just MC servers well they are modded with over 150 mods and diagnosing problems and formulating solutions is a daily job for me. Also having some Java knowledge is certainly helpful. From the time I log in to teamspeak and my server I basically become a PR REP for my work and my staff. I have also been an admin on the largest GMOD: DarkRP servers in the world.	4-6 months	Although it can be a little imatrure at some times it is overall a good community that seems to be growing daily. I like coming on to see what awesome content has been posted.
5/31/2015 18:22:24	http://www.reddit.com/user/JamesTheBrit96/	GMT+0	19	Basic Knowledge of Java	I was a Pug Leader for a community called Konvict Gaming and have ran servers like TS and CS server in the past	Have been a regular for 5 months love it, its part of my week now	its a great addition to the cs community, its also good for "newbies" too look for help	this Reddit account i am applying with is new due to losing my old account after Formatting my PC	10-12 months	well you have the normal trolls but whats reddit with out them its the same as all communitys has its Pros and Cons
5/31/2015 18:41:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/joe56780	GMT+0	19	Very slight in CSS, as in to do basic layouts for subreddits. I wouldn't come close to what you've already got though.	No, I'm very sorry.	Honestly I don't take part in this much.	Good way to help players learn, not done it myself but looked through the threads. It's fun and pressure free.	Names Joe, been through the Earth and back to get where I am today. I'm a simple man, just happy as long as I get my Cup o' Joe and 7 hours CSGO per day.  I have vast experience at moderating medium sized subreddits, such as /r/milakunis, /r/that70sshow and /r/joe56780. Though obviously these can't compare with this amazing, wonderful subreddit run by handsome and beautiful moderators.  I'm pretty down to Earth and I judge people for what they do rather than who they are. If I see a well known streamer breaking sub rules? He is out. I'm also pretty high ranked at CSGO, hitting Gold Nova 1 today, so I'm familiar with most pro players from competitive queue as well as watching them.  If you want someone to protect the innocent at any cost, I'm your man. I don't always do it the nice way, but I get the job done at any cost. Justice is truth and I can guarantee I won't get power hungry, maybe. 	10-12 months	Great sub, not corrupt since the mods are fantastic and lovely and so nice and honest. Doesn't raise controversy because it keeps things straightforward, just the way I like it.
5/31/2015 18:43:22	http://reddit.com/user/SimplifyEUW	GMT+1	19	I have experience in HTML and CSS.	I've been an admin on a few popular minecraft servers, one of them was pretty big. I've also been an admin on an old popular teamspeak server.  I have a feeling this isn't what you mean though but I'll leave it up anyway. I have never been an admin on a CS:GO server.	Great idea! Gives the community a chance to get together and have fun, regardless of rank and other things.	Also a great idea. I tend to help out a lot on /r/summonerschool which is a subreddit for teaching new players League of Legends, helping out people on CS:GO is awesome too! I'm only Silver Master Elite myself, so I'm not sure whether I'm fit to give advice!	Sup mods! I'm Jake, 19 years old and from England. Currently a university student studying Media which involves things such as graphic design, coding, 3D modelling, web authoring, film production etc.  Hobbies!: I love music, constantly on spotify and I plan on going to Ultra Music Festival 2016 in miami. Favorite genres would be Electronic/EDM, Drum & Bass and whatever's on the radio. Gaming is probably the biggest hobby of mine. I started PC gaming in 2011 when I picked up League of Legends, been playing it for 4 years and I'm currently ranked Platinum 1, I've reached Diamond this season too!  Another hobby/skill of mine is graphics design. I've been a graphics designer since 2008, I started learning photoshop at the age of 13 and my knowledge has helped me out a lot, even helped me get into University! I love creating graphics, ranging from sites, logo's/icon's, backgrounds, wallpapers, promotional material etc.   I've been wanting to moderate a subreddit for quite some time. I believe I've been on Reddit since 2012 and I'm on Reddit literally every day, so I might as well do something useful whilst I'm on Reddit! I also love interacting with and helping people. 	7-9 months	/r/GlobalOffensive is without a doubt the best run subreddit out of all of the Esports games. I've been lurking on /r/GlobalOffensive since September 2014, when I purchased CS:GO. I can't really comment on any particular changes that I have seen but the community is great for many reasons:  They help out newbies, the shitposts are minimum (and pretty funny unlike the /r/leagueoflegends shitposts), the match threads are very well done and nearly all threads I see on /r/GlobalOffensive spark a good discussion.
5/31/2015 18:44:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/saddy_dumpington/	GMT-7	17	I'm in a computer science class at school, where I learned some Java.	I once talked and played with some people who were admins in a DayZ mod server.	It seems like a good way for people in the subreddit to get together, have fun, and meet new players.	It seems like a good way for new players to have their questions answered.	I got counter strike in the 2014 summer sale and it has since taken over my life. I also tend to lurk more than I post.	7-9 months	It's been getting bigger as csgo gets more popular, and there seems to be some more low effort posts than usual, but that could just be me.
5/31/2015 18:52:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/mossawi	GMT+1	22	HTML CSS PHP JAVASCRIPT JQUERY SQL JAVA	Just some basic servers on my computer. 	Never participated before, but trying to let the community get to know each other and to have fun is great!	Many duplicated every week, but it is great if you need a quick summary of last week. Like answeree questions about last weeks update.	My name is Mounaim. 22 years old. Im a student and webdeveloper. Currently doing the study "informatics". I live in the netherlands and I play alot of CS:GO. Started playing CS:S in 2007.	4-6 months	The trolls are annoying. But thats not something you can do anything about. I like it when other members try to think with you.
5/31/2015 19:05:16	http://reddit.com/user/switchyTM	GMT+0	19	I've been a freelance developer ever since I was 13. I am employed as a full-time web developer which in my day to day use is HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, SASS, Git and all your main functionalities. I'm currently looking in to PHP and vue.js.	I used to own several communities ever since I was young, manually putting up servers for CS/Garry's Mod and many other source games. I have experience in leadership of a semi-large community (300+) and managing all server sand developing addons in G-Lua. Which I haven't done for about 4 years now.	Absolutely perfect, a way of bringing everyone together to just chill out, play and have fun.	It's always good to bring new people to the scene of counter-strike and is definitely a motion we'd want to keep pushing forward as we know the CS community is currently a toxic one, but we are many that aren't toxic and love to help people out. I for one.	I'm a really big all-time gamer, I've recently started streaming and it's so much fun. A lot of people interact with you and it makes you feel like you're an actual human not just a guy playing video games on the internet. I really would like to take it up as a full time job sometime.  I've been gaming ever since I was 2 (Video proof, on the really really old cameras.) My first game wad Quake. I also taught myself to read not long after because my father was playing battlefield 1942 and I really wanted to join in, so somehow I taught myself how to read so I could play all those games with my father and we spent a lot of time doing so. I guess you could say, gaming is my background.  At 13 I had troubles deciding what I wanted to be when I grew up, my brother threw a laptop and a book at me and said "Learn This" which leads me on to being a web developer now, it's great fun and I love being artistic and trying to use the latest web technologies in all of my projects.  I hope to be picked as a moderator because I think I could bring some great things to the community, host servers for EU to get some friendly matches played being one of them. I think it's really fun to just try get as many people involved as possible.  Thank you for reading this, I hope I get picked and we'll talk soon! Have a good one guys!	0-3 months	I've been lurking here for about a year, but recently made an account because I recently went big in trading and wanted somewhere I could trust to make such trades (I'm the guy who lost £5000. Kill me.).   I think the community is great a lot of people will just help with anything without having to be sarcastic and straight to the point. It could do with growing a lot larger because the more CS players the better! Some of the guys in here can/will do some amazing things and I look to the future of Global Offensive all together.

No	I think it is a good idea and those who know about it like it, but it could be better articulated.	I think there should be a daily simple questions mod thread similar to that of /r/buildapc and it should be made clear that these two things are not the same	Not much to say. I have taken multiple leadership training courses, I enjoy computers and everything related to them. I really like this game and I really like reddit so with those two things in mind I think I would be a good fit for the position. Thank you	4-6 months	I think people can be toxic but we all have a common appreciation for the game and that provides a level playing field allowing for healthy discussion which is often made use of
5/31/2015 19:38:54	http://reddit.com/u/Tyson100roxs	GMT+10	17	Batch, CSS, HTML, PHP and a little (not much) C#	I ran a Gmod community for about a year and have managed a server hosting companys for about 2 years. The servers were hosted through a website Dedicate Box and I was in-charge of live support, I would help people with there TF2, CSS, CSGO and Gmod servers, I have a fair bit of experience in admiring/running and creating/maintaining servers.	Sounds good.	Sounds like fun.	I am a 17 year old boy who lives in Australia, I have only recently got reddit after leeching for about a year without an account, I generally come to /r/GlobalOffensive to see frag videos and just read the comments on things that people post (i.e Easter eggs or News on pro players). I have played just over 850 hours of CSGO now and really just want to help moderate to give back to the community. There is no real reason why you should pick me over anyone else except for my will to help.   - Have a nice day :D	0-3 months	Its a really good community (one of my most viewed on reddit) :D  Always nice to see people sharing frag videos and people making jokes about CS.
5/31/2015 19:46:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/qwertyum110896/	GMT-5	18	I do not have experience in coding, though I could take the time to learn anything that is necessary.	I used to admin a few JailBreak servers in CSS around 2006-2008 for a friend of mine. I run a 5v5 PUG server for CS:GO right now. I also run a 2 TeamSpeak servers for my clan.	Community night is a great chance to bring the community together, though at times it can be a cluster-f**k due to too many people talking, lots of people being there, etc. It is to my understanding that all those problems will be ironed out in teamspeak. 	It is a great chance for the newer players and even experienced players to ask questions that aren't really covered in-depth via tutorials and other tips & guides.	My name is Matt Fulton. I have been playing counter-strike since around 2005/6. I have been a part of many communities. Seen lots of communities build up and then crumble down. I am recently (about a year ago) getting back into CS:GO and would like to help better the community and potentially grow it to be the number one E-Sports game. I do not have much to offer when it comes to being a mod other than past experience, and a passion to see this community grow. I can bring many new ideas to the table and help execute them.  Thank you for taking the time to read my application.  Sincerely, Matt Fulton ("Qwertyum110896" on reddit, and "Satan's Sassy Left Clit" on steam)	7-9 months	At times, especially around big news events, the community can be a bit toxic. All that is is ignorant (unknowing) players hoping on band-wagons and accusing people of certain things. There isn't much you can do about that besides ban them or nuke their threads if they become unacceptable and hurt the community.
5/31/2015 19:53:45	http://www.reddit.com/user/new_wav	GMT-5	21	I'm a part time web developer and graphic designer. Currently I'm in my last year of college finishing up a degree in Computer Graphics and Multimedia Design. It involves a lot of web development and UI front end design.	I have experience admining servers. I had a fairly popular server back in Source for the last two years or so of it. Then moved it onto CSGO. We've had all kinds of servers in that time be it PUG mod or like 1v1 servers or whatever else. Currently I have a few running as part of a practice server network.  You can see them all on http://cooltable.org/  We also have a fairly successful minecraft server that has been around for a few years now as well.  Additionally working inline with what I said about my degree I have experience admining web servers and such as well.	I like the idea a lot. I don't really participate because I have my friends I like to play with and don't much care for playing with a lot of random or unknowns at once. I don't even solo queue in matchmaking 99% of the time.  At that if it builds a lot of the community and people really enjoy it I'd be happy to help keep it going be it by setting up servers, admining or anything along those lines.	Overall a good idea and lets a lot of even experienced people ask questions they may or may not be asked a lot or easy to find. It also largely feels like a place for people who might be scared questions ask questions since sometimes there is a lot superiority in the CS community.	I've been on CS and around reddit for a long time. I do mod some other medium sized subreddits but I really like the CSGO and CS community be it at large or on the subreddit.  I want to be a mod for that reason, I have experience on reddit, I have experience admining server. I think I'd be a good help for those reasons. I'm really passionate about the community and basically just want to help.	3-4 years	I really enjoy it and have been involved in counter-strike for years now. Have a over 300 hours on Source and over 650 hours on CSGO. I never played 1.6 on Steam but played cracked copies and stuff back in early high school with friends before we really discovered source existed.  In that time I've learned a lot from the community. I think a lot of the community is good, more good than bad but be it players on forums or actually in game the CS community is good in the majority.  The subreddit I feel the same way about it. Sometimes the elitist assholes rise to the top but for the most part a lot of people are good. The content is by and large good. Most members are easy to get along with.
5/31/2015 19:57:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/moosenberg/	GMT-4	27	I have a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, where I learned some HTML/CSS/Java/C++. Also learned a bit of Assembly and Python. I'm not overly proficient in any single one of them, but I know basics/intermediate syntax and coding for at least some of them, and I definitely have the brain for coding. If necessary, I could learn some things in my free time.	I have hosted servers in almost every game I have played, since I was around 16-17 years old. This includes CS 1.6. I've been the leader of countless communities in the games that interest me at those specific points in time. I also have a lot of experience messing with plugins and add-ons for quite a few games, CS included. I have experience in hosting my own servers, as well as renting them and using the server dashboard/admin controls/whatever you would like to call them.	Anything to get people involved and talking. Events are great ways to get people to network, and even to bring people back to the game.	CS is somewhat notorious for having a less-than-friendly community towards new players, especially in the competitive scene. Something like this that gives new players opportunities to reach out and familiarize themselves with the game is great in my opinion. Helping new players is, at least to me, one of the biggest reasons this subreddit has grown as much as it has since it started.	I would make a great admin, honestly. I might not be the best, nor the most qualified, but I would make a great addition to the team and I would definitely do my part to help (and more, if given the chance). I'm kind a troll myself, but I make an effort to not cross certain lines, and I'm generally very respectful and knowledgeable. I also am good at keeping a level head, especially when a problem arises, whereas many others might get aggravated or angry.   I also am very passionate about changing the game for the better. One particular problem that I have with Valve is their transparency with the CS:GO community. I would like to do what I can to get Valve to appoint a dedicated representative for Reddit solely, or for the online community in general, to give more regular feedback and updates on what is happening with the game. I've already written messages to some of Valve's staff as well as to GabeN :)  I'm a Legendary Eagle Master (pre vac waves) and am generally pretty decent at the game. I play mostly casual/128-tick deathmatch/KZ maps, but I am down to play just about anything. I really hope you consider me, but if you go with someone else, I wish you guys the best of luck finding n00bs to help clean up your new posts (among other things), and RIP in peace if I don't hear back from you!  	7-9 months	I honestly play CS:GO more for the community than anything else. Like I mentioned before, they can be a bit harsh towards new players, but this community has a more-trolly side, and generally has more fun, than pretty much any other community I've ever been a part of. Once you learn the game, the community is a blast to be around. Sometimes people can get annoying (especially with mic spam OMG), but in general people are a blast to talk to.
5/31/2015 20:02:33	https://www.reddit.com/user/Fluttershy_Sucks/	GMT+10	16	I have a moderate knowledge of HTML5 and python 3.			Some answers are slightly over complicated for some of the intended audience, but the ones who want to learn do get a good experience out of it.	I'm 16, bordering on 17. I live in Australia, and I've been playing GO for about 7 months. I got into it because I was staying at a friends house the day before we were planning to play 1.6 at a LAN, and he showed me a few basic things in GO, and then I started playing it after. My favourite map is Mirage, My worst map is Train, and I have really bad internet, so I can only really play on Sydney servers.	0-3 months	The reddit community is fine, IMO it's one of the high points of the CS community.
5/31/2015 20:16:16	http://www.reddit.com/user/YeahMann/	GMT-3	17	No I do not.	No I do not.	I like the idea, and I think another good idea would be to have maybe monthly or bi-monthly community tournaments where anyone from the subreddit could sign up with their team of 5 and play a 1-3 day tournament against other teams from the subreddit.	I like it. It mainly accomplishes two things; It cuts down on all the "Silver 1 needs help/tips to rank up" threads, and also helps anyone who may have a random question about the game, even if they have their fundamentals down pat.	I am a 17 year old junior in high school, and I live in Nova Scotia, Canada. I go by the name "Murrill" online.  I have followed eSports for about 2-3 years, starting with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 season in 2013. Since then I have followed CoD eSports very attentively, checking  the /r/CoDCompetitive subreddit almost every day to catch up on all the news.  Then I was introduced to CSGO. I didn't pay attention to the game very much at first, but about 3 months ago I really put my mind to getting better and in turn, I have become a very active member of the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit. I rarely visit /r/CodCompetitive anymore, and my interest for Call of Duty is dying rapidly, with CSGO replacing it.  I think I would be a good moderator because I have a lot of experience with CSGO and eSports in general and I am online the subreddit almost 6 hours every weekday.  I consider myself a very smart/understanding individual with nothing but good things to contribute to the moderation team; But I can also be very patient when someone has something to say, especially if it is criticism, as I am always trying to improve myself in any way.  Thanks for reading! -Murrill	4-6 months	I really love the /r/GlobalOffensive community.  Since I have started frequently visiting the subreddit, it has improved my game a LOT - there are lots of informative and helpful posts. Also, it is one of the most mature eSports communities on reddit. I used to be a frequent visitor of /r/CoDCompetitive, and most of their posts revolve around drama and other stuff that doesn't really add to the community aspect, IMO you don't find a whole lot of that in /r/GlobalOffensive.  Also the layout and the design of the subreddit is one of my favorites on reddit.
5/31/2015 20:20:31	http://reddit.com/user/drunkkk_	UTC-8	15	Java, one year of intro in school, and AP java next year as well	I was an admin on a TF2 server for quite a while. It was a trading server, and my job was to stop spam in chat, kick toxic people, etc.		Newbie Thursday is really helpful to many people, even people such as myself who have played Counter-Strike for hundreds of hours. It should definitely be kept going.	I'm a very sincere person who will usually do what I think is right, and I wanted to give back to this subreddit for all the hours it's made my boredom go away.  I realize I have very little chance of becoming a mod due to my fresh account on reddit with relatively little karma, so I'll just lay out the facts as they are.  Negatives:  - I can probably only put in a hour or so each day - Newish reddit account with not much karma  Positives:  - I sincerely care about any positions of power I get, I took that admin role on that TF2 server quite seriously   I also just wanted to say you mods are doing a nice job, keep it up =D	4-6 months	The subreddit has, in my time here, taken a turn for the worse. I had lurked on reddit for many months prior to creating an account, and I feel that back then, the sub had many more quality posts about gameplay, helping others, and whatnot. Lately, the sub has become a massive complaint against everything Valve does, rather than any meaningful content.  The community itself is quite nice, especially you beautiful mods. For the most part, everyone is polite and helpful, and this is the sub I'd like to be a mod for, if any.
5/31/2015 20:52:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/KingNachoCheese/	UTC-5	14	Javascript, I used to create Minecraft modifications.  Very minor HTML experience.	Yes, I've administrated on multiple Minecraft servers before.   I'm in the process of becoming a moderator on the CS:GO server network,  "Swoobles!".	I haven't had enough experience with Community Night to have an opinion on it.	I haven't had enough experience with Newbie Thursday to have an opinion on it.	I love playing CS:GO, I currently have 670 hours in the game.  My MatchMaking rank is Master Guardian 1.  I love playing Minecraft in my spare time to just chill, and take a break from Counter-Strike.  My name's Harry.  I'd love to be part of the moderation team to further collaborate and help the community!	4-6 months	The moderation team is fantastic compared to other mod teams on reddit (/r/leagueoflegends).  The community can be overwhelmingly helpful at times, or a complete and utter meme-filled circlejerk. 
5/31/2015 21:17:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/Kron-Prinz/	GMT+6	19	HTML/PHP/CSS. Can work with C/C++, Java.	Hosted CS 1.6 servers based on Linux OS. (.steam.sh, screen server1 ./hlds.sh +map de_dust2 blablabla). Worked with amxmodx, plugins. Now hosting server in Russia (Moscow) small retakes server for my friendlist/players. 146.255.193.246:27218. Don't know how to work with sourcemod (create plugins), at least know how to configure/install etc.	I didn't participated in one of those because i got a high ping (~120) on EU and (~250) on US servers. So, don't know, but i can participate once and after i can tell you.	Nothing, it's good as it is.	I'm 19 years old player (1995) from Kazakhstan/Almaty. I'm knowing english a bit, not good, but can understand anything. Just want to help the community and add something that will help somebody in future. Got ~3000 h. and Global Elite. I know it doesn't matter, but now i don't have any reasons to put whole time in-game, and now i can do something else. Like moderating reddit :)	7-9 months	I don't want to change it totally, but some things should be corrected. At least, when moderators delete threads, they should add reason why they are removing, because some of my friends are quietly raging about that. I know about reddiquette/rules, but even if they read that, some of them don't really know why they got their post deleted. I just want to moderate new posts. 
5/31/2015 21:35:50	http://www.reddit.com/user/Squiirtzz/	UTC+10	21	I have VERY brief experience in Javascript.	I was a Mod for a CoD 4 server back in the day. {AUS} was the clan. I was basically a 2nd Admin for the server, but without the privilege of controlling the server via the webpage. Everything I managed was in game with the game console.	None.	I quite like the idea and it's a good way to help out new reddit users.	Well, my name is Jayden, As you know, I am a 1994 child. I love to contribute and help around where ever possible. I am quite proud of my achievements in life so far and look forward to adding more to the list to look back on and be proud of myself. I am known as the "Gentle Giant" from friends and family due to my height and personality. (6ft1, I know, I'm not that tall these days). I work 5 days a week 9am-5pm. But during that time, I multi task between reddit and work. My workplace is very chill and is mostly "AFK" work (reinstalling OS, installing software, etc). I am a CS player since the start of the year and am improving everyday. I have a team that I have joined and play with also. I currently live at home but am looking to move out ASAP as the family are moving to another state. But you don't need to know about that I guess haha. Anyways, to sum it up, I am a hard worker when needed, willing to learn and try new things, and always look at the positive side of things. Hope to get to know you all and thank you for taking your time to read this application!  Regards, Jayden	0-3 months	I honestly love the feed back people give on your posts. Weather its negavite, or positive. It keep growing and I cant wait to see where it stands in a couple of years time! Obviously there are trolls around every corner. But that's normal. Ever since I joined at the start of the year, I have been enjoying reading peoples ideas, opinions and watching peoples game play. Look forward to the near future :)
5/31/2015 21:35:58	http://www.reddit.com/user/killercillian	GMT+1	21	Recently got an Adobe certification for HTML5, can work with HTML5 and CSS, a small bit of Javascript too.	I do not.	Good way for new users to make friends and bring the community closer together.	Same thoughts as Community Night, a good way to bring new users together, make some friends or learn new tips/strategies.	I'm Cillian,  I'm a 21 year old student from Dublin, Ireland currently studying HTML, CSS, SQL and PHP in college.  I've being playing video games my whole life and love to play all types of games, I've being playing CS for years and years but only recently have got serious about Counter Strike: GO, I used to just spent most of my time in CS:S on Zombie or Surf servers.  I love all kinds of music and playing music, I play guitar, bass, keyboard and drums.  I've never had experience as an admin on any site/server but I think I'd be a good admin, I'm not one to get advantage of it or let it get to my ego. I just wanna make sure someone isn't ruining the fun for someone else or spamming the same old rant about some feature or gun they don't like in CS: GO over and over.  I go to college from 9-5 Monday to Friday, which most of that time I spent with at least one Reddit tab open so I'm pretty active and will always be around to check on the subreddit to see what's being posted, and make sure nothing out of the normal is happening.	0-3 months	Nice little place but a lot of people sure love to complain a lot about the game.
5/31/2015 21:39:23	http://reddit.com/u/sir_kommandante	GMT+12	19	HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby.  I spent a few months being a freelance web designer, mostly as a hobby, but to also fund my studies.	I was a senior admin for a NZ/Australasian FPS community (TNZ clan) which hosted games ranging from CS:GO to Battlefield, Rust and Americas Army.  I was involved in general game administration, such as kicking, banning (with proof beyond reasonable doubt) and map rotation.	I would like to expand community night, bringing the Australasian region in.  It is a good concept, but needs work.   Possibly implement a rewards system to attract a bigger player base.	Its a great way for those to ask questions that would seem 'shameful' by those who are long established players -it's nice to be able to ask something without being judged.	I have been in the CS scene since 1.6, whilst I am not particularly a good player, I play simply for the enjoyment it provides, and the diverse and 'unique' community that plays it.  It has been wonderful to watch this game grow, especially with eSports.  I am a gamer by heart, it's something I have always been passionate about.  With my experience in game management, I believe I could be a valuable asset to this community.  I am a fair, unbiased person, who does not take action without reasonable cause.	4-6 months	/r/GlobalOffensive is one of the few communities which seem balanced, there are a few issues here and there, but majority of users seem to be able to express their varying opinions without being lambasted.  A wide variety of content is also on display, and this sub doesn't take itself too seriously.
5/31/2015 21:41:38	http://www.reddit.com/user/nuradan/	UTC+1	20	Sorry got none.	As before none :).	I praticipated in the Community Night just recently, it was a nice experience. Playing with players without the restriction of any rank and learning from the best the community offers. 	I think the Newbie Thursday is helping the new but also the old members of this community and the game. I for example, even though I play CS:GO for 1 yeah now (1.2k+) can still learn a few things at the Newbie Thursday.  Maybe you could stick the latest Newbie Thursday on the sidebar so the community is able to see the post the whole week, the Newbies maybe just run over this reddit and don't know there is such a post so they can see it even though they just visit the subreddit once a week.	Hello my name is Benedikt and I am 20 years old coming from Germany. Until last week I was still a pupil but I finally took my exam  :). Because I want to start to study now I will certainly find enough time to moderate this subreddit. As I mentioned before the technical side to support this subreddit wouldn't be good to lay into my hands. But I think I would really enjoy moderating this subreddit. Even now I am roughly at least a hour on this subreddit. I still enjoy Counter-Strike very mutch and see now reason for this to change. This subreddit teached me well how I can get better in the game we all love so mutch. I think I really would enjoy working with all of you.	4-6 months	I think the community is quite good, but there are always some negativ sides. For example the reddit way seems like only the popular opinion will get to the frontpage and opinions that aren't popular die in the new section. I myself tried to start some posts but they died there. Thats totally cool but maybe the mods could make a sticky post once a week or month where you can't be downvoted for your opinion, of course the mods would have to watch out that the thread won't get kidnapped by trolls.  But reddit seems to lack a lot of trolls or you the mods are just doing a good job :), because i nearly don't see any trolls even on the bottom on the thread.  
5/31/2015 21:55:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/RadiantSun	GMT-5	21	HTML, JavaScript, CSS Python and C#, but I'm no computer genius man and I'm not that great at it, I'm just mentioning it because you asked.	For a brief time, I had my own CSGO servers for my team to practice on, and occasionally surf on. I also had my own TF2 server that ran Mario Kart 24/7 and I am presently an admin on a Minecraft server that caters to the old internet community from the &TOTSE forums and it's successor forums.	I'd like to see some form of coaching for newer players in the community, but otherwise I think it is a good idea. I also think it would be a good idea to switch to Team speak, but that's obviously just a matter of opinion and not a big deal, I just think Teamspeak is easier and more intuitive to use.	I think it's a great idea but the it could be taken a step further. As I said above, if we could integrate it with some sort of coaching, like an "adopt a silver" type deal, we would be doing something no other community can offer.	I'm a 21 year old college guy from Pakistan, living in Florida, and I love video games. I am primarily in love with Super Smash Bros and Counter Strike, and these days I only play CS. I have spent a majority of my adult life working in advertising, and I own and operate an advertising agency in my home country. I have four kitties and they all love Counter Strike as much as I do. I am known to be a Tinder God and have successfully gotten at least 14 people laid, which some people think is pretty cool. I think I'll fit in well with the crew. Looking forward to getting onboard!	19-24 months	As the sub has grown bigger, the number of garbage comments has increased. I don't mean stuff I don't agree with, or lighthearted content, I don't think a post needs to be a long essay to be "good". I mean posts that genuinely do nothing but spew vitriol, crap on lower rank players and discourage them and generally create a sour atmosphere that squashes discussion. At the same time, I think the number of good comments and posts have risen as well. What stands to be done now is to control the bad posters while encouraging the good ones.
5/31/2015 22:05:55	http://www.reddit.com/user/thehawkpower/	GMT-4	16	No.	I have a lot of experience hosting many League of Legends servers, not CS:GO one though. Most of the servers we're for tournaments only and my job was to deal with the trolls & toxic people or any disputes that could happen during the tournaments hours. Name of the communities, CLC & Trigon Gaming.	N/A	I like it, makes people interact with eachother in a friendly and helpful way which is awesome for the community.	I am french Canadian redditor, soon to enter college (we only have 5 years of high school) and my love gaming overall. I have played a lot of games ranging from Age of Empires to Street Figther. I played some lans when Black Ops 2 came out, was pretty good at it. Since then I have been hooked up to the eSports scene. I watch the pro scene of 3 different eSports and I have played tournaments in the LoL scene, though none of them were super big (top prize pool was around 150$). I coached some Diamond LoL teams, but it was boring so I stopped. Now I mostly spend all of my time browsing this subreddit, lurking most of the time as I am still trying to accommodate to this community.	0-3 months	Coming from the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit, I am living the dream! The peoples are respectful (most of the time) and I in 3 months I have never had any problem with the mods decisions or actions.
5/31/2015 22:13:31	https://www.reddit.com/user/NotaCola_RTM/	GMT+10	16	Not yet but in IT at school we are doing coding and websites in Term 3 	N/A	I'm not that guy that goes to parties in real life but online if there is a community event then I'd be happy to join	Didn't really notice it.	I am 16. I am above average in school. I am a male. I used to be part of the console peasants. Would Love to be a mod on csgo subreddit. I am straight forward and dont like to go around the bushes. I am usually happy but if I see someone that is trying to scam, smurf, cheat or anything against the rules then I turn into the hulk. I dont have a deep voice but not a squeaker voice either so yea. I don't like being abusive when our team is winning like (12 - 2) on the Sided map as that is unsportsman like. I think flusha did cheat but stopped after the vac waves and hackusations but I don't really like talking about a pro cheating when there is no bedrock (Not a minecraft reference, however the big bang theoriy) evidence    My csgo profile is new as I have many accounts as my name wasn't really set until 3 - 5 months ago as it was DanieL, NotaCola, Rockacola, NotaSchool and now its set to NotaCola_RTM.	0-3 months	I believe that most of the people using it are genuine but one troll answer makes the whole topic of something not genuine and makes it difficult for someone that really wants to get their opinion out there.
5/31/2015 22:22:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/josephk518/	GMT-4	18	Little experience in HTML, Javascript, and Python.	Yes. I've helped moderate and admin a minecraft server for about 3 years now. During my time as a staff there, i've had responsibilities such as keep chat appropriate, making sure our members were happy, running forum games, and helping script certain features of our server.	I unfortunately have not been to many, mainly because of school, but the one's I have attended were very fun.	It's a great idea. When I first started to get into CSGO, that was one of the first places I went to try to get my head around the game. It provides a safe place to ask the noobish questions without being yelled at.	I'm 18. I'm a guy. I play a lot of video games.  On a more serious note, I tend to be a quieter guy, but i'm also very talkative sometimes. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, hear both sides of a story, but am not afraid to lay down the law, so to speak.  Honestly, i'm not going to try to make myself seem better than I really am. I'm a pretty chill guy, most people think that. I get along with most people.	4-6 months	I think it has a lot of potential. However, the one thing I would like to change is the comments section. I've noticed in some threads, there are civil discussions, but in others, it can get toxic very quickly. This may be due to the large amount of new players joining within the last 6 months or so, but I feel like this is something that can definitely be improved. One thing I do enjoy is what the community is doing. There are regular events, which I feel is what keeps a community going.
5/31/2015 22:29:12	http://reddit.com/user/Jpon9	GMT-8	16	UH YEAH	DUH	Anal sex	The worst	I hate being wordy. 	0-3 months	Less active than /r/leagueoflegends
5/31/2015 23:14:37	http://www.reddit.com/user/IbuprofenCS	GMT-7	25	Slight knowledge in HTML. Took several classes on it while in school as well as some picked up knowledge from time online.	I do not have experience in admining CSGO servers, but I do have history with admining ventrilo and teamspeak servers along with CoD, CoD2, and CoDMW servers for competitive modes for competitive leagues such as TWL and CAL (before they shut down).  	Honestly I don't think I could be a critic of Community Nights having only been involved in two events. Though if I had to give my opinion on it I would say they are one of the better events that isn't filled with toxic/negative players. Everyone seems to legitimately want to help each other within the game.	I have not been involved at all with Newbie Thursday other than knowing about it.	My name is Alexander, but in game I go by vapoR. I'm currently still enlisted with the US Navy (6+ Years) and am coming closer to getting out. I am married and have two wonderful children. My history with PC gaming goes back to the age of 12 playing competitively within the Rainbow Six scene (remember GameSpy?). I have played within many teams for several different games. My love for the competitive scene has only grown stronger with CSGO and because how we as viewers can watch professional matches. This sub has just added fuel to my passion for E-Sports and if selected as a Mod for this community that would be my goal, help new players understand this scene as well as giving our more experienced players a place to get more information, maybe a few laughs too. 	13-18 months	From the time I came to find /r/GlobalOffensive till today there is so much that has changed that this honestly could be a college essay. To keep this short and sweet, I think this sub is heading in the right place. There was a time where there was nothing but fluff and it got to the point where I was becoming no longer interested in this sub. Today you're team has done a lot to make this sub a more interactive one and is catering to every type of player that wants something to do with CSGO. 
5/31/2015 23:15:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/kinggamer757	GMT-5	14	No, sorry.	I was a paid admin for awhile on hellsgamers. I then got free admin on their jailbreak and deathmath servers. I do have experience.	I think they are great ways to bring the community together.	Great idea. Really helps noobs understand the game through asking questions. I was helped there.	I love to moderate things. I like to make sure things run smoothly.I would be very interested in helping along the community via the moderation team.	7-9 months	I think that it is a great community. Fads come and go, some good and some bad.
5/31/2015 23:49:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/irv	GMT-4	28	I do, but I'm primarily a system administrator in my career. I would prefer to keep moderation duties to moderation and not coding, but I can always help test layouts, etc.	Sure, I've hosted servers for years, since 1.6. Linux/Windows. Remotely assisted admins setting up servers/ebot for recent BaseLAN event.	It's not bad, I usually only pop in for map playtests. FMPONE will give me a good reference ;)	Valuable for the newcomers to the community.	Been playing CS for 15 years, didn't play CSS. Played GO since release. Active in various IRC communities, active moderator for several Twitch chats: theREALhandi, m0e_tv, shahzam, dum0re, n4n0teh. Systems Administrator is my career and I work for a non-profit in Canada. I would likely be around between 9 and 5 depending on the day's duties and occasionally in the evening, but I do play CS during the evening usually 6-9pm :)  Any further questions just ask. 	2-3 years	A good balance is critical, and I think it's been achieved over the years. I don't know what the bulk of removed posts are, but I do have an eye for shitposts in general, and determining whether or not posts follow or break rules.
5/31/2015 23:51:05	http://www.reddit.com/user/itsflashpoint	GMT-5	18	Little HTML experience.	I have admined my own CSGO server although it wasn't for the public, just for myself to practice etc.  I am also an experienced administrator on the SA-MP community, I owned my own servers, and I was an admin on other servers.  As well, I am experienced with Minecraft administration, I had an active server had about 20 people online from the day I launched it.			I am an 18 year old male, about to turn 19 on June 21st, I am a realllllly boring person. I've ran a forum in the past with couple of thousand of members but it sadly went down due to lack of funding, but I've gained some experience from that. 	4-6 months	Although, I am not 100% active on /r/GlobalOffensive I think the community is generally nice, just like any sub-reddit. I don't really post that much on the sub-reddit so I don't really have much thoughts about it.
5/31/2015 23:53:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/bussianranana/	GMT+0	19	Yes i have worked with HTML,PHP,C++ and java script but not extensively. 	Yes, I have made around 3-4 servers mainly to learn the source engine, They were hosted through my own linux server and i made them from scratch.	I think the Community nights are excellent, They give the people of the SubReddit a chance to play together/Against each other.	Newbie Thursday is awesome i read through them alot when i was first getting into Counter-Strike	Well i'm an Irish guy who from then age of around 10 loved the idea of having a PC and could only play games on the ps2 then I got a ps3 and started playing CoD for a few years but then moved to playing PC mainly DayZ (at 7fps) for around 6-7 months and then I started looking into making games and learnt most on the Unity Engine and after that I started learning HTML, Then I found Counter-Strike when I started playing Counter-Strike I was quite bad at it and a friend showed me Surfing and I loved it instantly and didn't really a comp after, Everyday I must have played a good 3 hours or more of surfing. Then I got asked to play a comp by a friend and I actually got kills and I thought I could get better at it. Now I have played like 1600 hours on CS:GO half being surfing, Then I started looking into map making spending 3 days watching YouTube tutorials iv made 1 map and now making another one, Oh and I have dabbled in UE4.But yeah that's me a Irish guys that loves PC and games.	0-3 months	The community overall is a nice one, id expect worse from them.
6/1/2015 0:11:02	http://reddit.com/u/_BearHawk	GMT-8	15	I can do HTML fluently (easy language) and consider myself fairly proficient in CSS, but I am still in the beginning stages of Java and jQuery.	I do not have experience with admin on CS:GO servers.	Community Night is amazing, I have been in one or two in the past, but when I was in one I really enjoyed it. I haven't done them so much anymore because I enjoy playing comp with my friends a little more.	I have not heard of Newbie Thursday, but if it is anything like I think it is (helping new players) it sounds awesome! I would love to attend one, I am only GN3 and looking to improve to keep up with my friends, who are all mostly MG1 - DMG.	I guess I'll start with the generic "How long you been playing vidya for" thing. I have been playing games since I was around 5 or 6 and only started playing CS:GO about 4 or 5 months ago. I was first in the TF2 competitive scene, did 2 seasons of UGC Steel Highlander with some people I met online, and it was the most fun thing I had ever done online. I realized that the TF2 competitive scene is really small and not growing much. Then, this december, I heard about some Juniors in my school talking about the upcoming ESL One Katowice tournament. I had heard of CS:GO, but never really known the competitive scene. So, I went online, and looked up ESL One. I clicked on EMS One finals instead (NiP vs VP, amazing, VP my fav after that :D) and fell in love with everything. Then, ESL One Katowice 2015 came around and I had a blast watching it with those Juniors at school (darn euro games play during our school hours :/) and them talking about all the plays and stuff. So yeah, that was how I really got into CS:GO. More about me, hm, where do I start? I haven't been around long enough to claim amazing things like "Oh, I have been on 4chan for 10 years" or whatever, but I consider myself a cultured internet user. That sounds like I would tip a fedora as I say that, ugh. But yeah, I love the internet, love CS:GO, combine that into a subreddit? Amazing.	4-6 months	I have not been here that long, but what I have seen of the community has been pretty awesome. Sure, there are a lot of opinionated statements surrounding players, teams, and skins, but generally the community kinda have each other's backs in a way. Most everything is either positive or sarcasm, with a bit of insult thrown in there. It is a community like none I have been in before.
6/1/2015 0:18:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/Gameattic1/	UTC-8	17	No	No	I like community nights, im part of a twitch channel "TheAttack" and we often have Gae nights with many other Subscribers and Fans	I do not know what Newbie Tuesday is.	Im 17 year old Senior in High School on Summer Break right now. When im not at school i either hang out with friends or Go on my PC and go on Reddit and Steam. Add me if you like:) (Gameattic1) . I have alot of time on my hands and i mostly spend that time at my Home on my PC. 	0-3 months	For the time being on /r/GlobalOffensive its been quite calm not like other Subs where post can be all over the wall. But sometimes rarely you get a bad apple in the bunch.
6/1/2015 0:27:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/flukeRRR/	GMT+1	23	Very crude C++ from first year of university.	N/A	Think they are a great idea, especially for those who find it hard to find friends within an online game and tend to end up solo the whole time. Haven't taken part in one as my team tends to play most evenings but if I were to become a mod I would probably make a real effort to do one at least once a month.	Newbie threads are almost essential for moba's because of the almost limitless interactions between heroes and items. I don't feel CS:GO ones offer as much for returning people week to week other than some intricate tactical questions or getting stuck at a point in mm. I do think they are a good addition though because of the large growth CS is experiencing and giving somewhere to go for all the redditors who pick up the game after seeing it on twitch or something.	I am from the UK with a Call of Duty 4 competitive background (went to some lans, scrimmed vs some of the top european teams.) Picked up CS back around August to see if I still knew how to play FPS after years of SC2, League and Dota 2 (Hit global recently so yay! =)). Am now just starting up a family business which will take my time during the day but am around all evening almost every evening and always browse reddit in between games and such with my team. Saw you fine chaps needed a bit of an extra hand and thought I'd offer my time if you'd like it. I'm not the most prolific poster but I tend to read almost everything. Thanks for taking the time to read all this drivel. <3 	7-9 months	My personal viewpoint on the community is that people fall into 2 categories for me. You have the "old boy" network of people who have been within the franchise for years bringing stories from history and constructive comments about balance and strategy and the new blood who tend to be more immature and all about "dem memes."
6/1/2015 0:33:22	http://www.reddit.com/user/xiic/	GMT-4	24	Awk and Python. I'm not a pro but I can get by. 	I currently admin a server for my friends to play on, nothing special.   In COD4 I was an admin on the Promod [EW] server for years. It was the most popular Promod server in NA for a very long time. 	I love the idea and I have taken part when I can but I wish it was run on more days of the week. Unfortunately I am busy every Tuesday. 	Great idea. 	I'm 24 years old, I live in Canada. I've been playing CS for about 10 years on and off. I do have quite a bit of experience managing forums and dealing with people online, I am the GM of a top 50 US WoW guild.   As I mentioned earlier I value transparency quite a bit, I dislike bureaucracy and heavy moderation. I think in general as long as posts do not have illegal or harmful content they should not be deleted, even if I personally don't agree with the post. I believe very strongly that censorship is wrong.   Overall I'm on reddit a ton. I have a desk job and reddit during the day. I think I'm a pretty even keeled person suited for the job, I hope you consider me. 	2-3 years	For the most part it's pretty good. It's not as whiny as some of the other esports related subreddits. I also like the general level that you guys moderate, as a rule I am against heavy moderation because it tends to veer into censorship. This is a major problem in a lot of other big subs right now. 
6/1/2015 0:36:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorK5/	UTC-5	17	I have some experience with Javascript but i wasn't very good at it. It's been a while since i used it but i could probably remember the basics.	I host a few private servers but really wasn't necessary to bring down the hammer as i only gave the ip to people i wanted to have it. But i used rcon and configs files and the console well when i was on them.	I love getting the community together for events. It's a good thing i'd like to see continue.	N/A	Well i've been playing CS:GO for around a year now. Didnt really care much for it a year ago then around September i got more into it. I played it 1st on my 360 which is not something i'm exactly proud of. I'm DMG and play CEVO from time to time and ESEA weekly. I hope i can join a open team soon but who knows. I really like to personalize my gear in CS also. I got an AWP Redline but paid more for an expensive iBP sticker on there because i have a computer made by them. I named my c4 in game and swapped my font out for a custom one. I just love the customization in this game so i take advantage of it. On a personal note im on my towns Volunteer Fire Department so i guess you could say i know what it's like to help the community without being asked. I really enjoy being on the VFD its something i hope to do for years even after college. Which i guess bring me to my next point of im going to attend University in the fall for Mechanical Engineering. Hopefully make a career out of that. Also my name is Connor if you didnt catch that from my name and i check the reddit probably over 20 times a day. A little excessive but i also get a good laugh from every trip. I really think i'd be a good mod for the subreddit and i look forward to hearing from you guys.	4-6 months	Well personally i've found this to be a lot better than other CS:GO sites like HLTV. I find the community here less toxic and a lot more relate-able. I know the pain when someone posts a gif of them failing in  CS:GO and i know the feel of triumph in those great AWP clutches. Sure there are people who couldn't be stupider(or troll harder) and then there are the innocent noobs but overall i see it as the best CS:GO community on the internet. You really can't have more variety than what this subreddit does. 
6/1/2015 0:36:51	http://www.reddit.com/user/jordinoo/	UTC-6	18	No.	Yes. I used to own both Aim Map servers, as well as FFA Pistol servers.	I enjoy community night, and would take part of it more if I could.	I like newbie Thursday, I feel it helps ease the fear or competitive for new players.	My name is Jordan, I have been a member of the r/globaloffensive reddit for about 16 months. I always check the reddit 6-8 times a day, as well as r/leagueoflegends. I currently work as a Nursing assistant, and enjoy playing video games in my off time. I'm pretty good at problem solving as well as communicating with a community.	13-18 months	I like the Subreddit as a whole, although there is some posts that I question when they hit the front page if they are really "relevant", but I feel that the mods do a good job of interacting with the community.
6/1/2015 0:39:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/t3sla1	GMT+10	43	I once installed windows	I created & lead Auschwitz 	fuckin sick brah	fuck the cunts	I am the king of the world, I own about 20% of the Muslim race in my basement, creepy fuckers always yellin some shit about allah. I'm a dank master in the arts of memes which is pretty good I must say. I pirated CS:GO for the whole time I was playing until the jew's fixed it then I had to pay $4 because of some sale. My bong is 3 coke cans stuck together with a Yakult bottle as my filter can you make me mod pls.	5+ years	love it 
6/1/2015 0:46:39	http://reddit.com/u/freakyfranchi	GMT+13	22	Some HTML and Java	I have experience admin/hosting CSGO servers in perth australia. Mostly used for casual competitive, and a couple of skrim servers as well. Also was an admin for (at the time) the most popular Arma 2 wasteland server. Only not an admin anymore because he stopped running it. I've also in the past run tf2 and garrys mod servers  I'm also the owner and main admin for a 9000 person TF2 Trading group on facebook	I think they're great, but since i'm from Australia it would be good if there was one organized for here. say maybe, get a new australian admin to do it ;D	Great idea, always need to help the new players in the community	Uni/Working. On my computer pretty much all day with reddit open. Play heaps of csgo	10-12 months	The best csgo community i've found is on /r/globaloffensive
6/1/2015 0:46:03	http://reddit.com/user/quartapple	GMT-8	19	Only JS.  Haven't done major projects, only took classes	Unfortunately, only small things such as Minecraft and Teamspeak servers. These were not big-name, large-group servers, but open servers that generally saw traffic from ~20 people regularly.	Needs an incentive for people to join. Currently it lacks such other than "play with other people who happen to be redditors"	Useful. Great way to ask questions about the game that would otherwise be unanswerable or at least very difficult to find an answer to. 	Currently going to the University of Washington, CSGO is definitely my second favorite game (only following behind GTAV, because c'mon). I love playing, and even though it can be frustrating at times it's a great way to form camaraderie and provides an outlet to hone competitive nature.   Used to play on a Macbook Air (I know) until I got a new computer which half of its purpose is to play this damn game. Since then I've found myself playing CSGO a lot more and enjoying it to an even larger degree.   I generally play competitive with a small group of friends, but other than that I can be found on surf servers, pistol FFA DM, and occasionally casual games. I enthusiastically follow the CSGO pro scene and make an effort to play Pick'Em whenever there's a major ( although I don't bet skins).   Other than CSGO I love mountain biking, airsoft and Magic: the Gathering, and finding time for each of my hobbies has always been a central part of my life.   I'd like to think of myself as able to mediate disputes and I feel that I would be made useful if I was added into the /r/GlobalOffensive moderation team. I am understanding and flexible and I am always willing to listen to the opposite opinion/argument before making a decision.	13-18 months	A good community. It is circlejerky, but it's hard to find a subreddit that isn't. my only complaint is that sometimes misinformation can be spread too rampantly (a good example is the whole flusha scandal). I don't feel that the subreddit content could be improved upon in any way by allowing such witchhunt-like comments in the threads.
6/1/2015 0:46:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/Kizzawulf/	GMT+10	19	Yes, i have coded for Garry's Mod and CS:GO communities before.  I know HTML, CSS and Java. I know a little bit of LUA but not so much anymore.  Haven't coded for about a month but if i get this position i will be sure to polish up my skills again.	Yes i was the Owner of the biggest gaming community of Garry's Mod "Pentagon Gaming". We branched out to CS:GO but since we were newish to GO we decided to not continue with the server and learn a bit more about the game.  Little did we know we would get hooked and just play MM and Community and the idea of our server on GO was slowly lost...  We have Hosted with Wombat Gaming (Useless) and Zellion (Great service) and we also hosted with a VPS (Was the best overall).  I was incharge of the Forums/Website maintenance as well as making sure the people who donated got their benefits etc.	I feel it is a great idea, it gets the community together and it really gets everyone talking and discussing what we all love, Counter Strike.  	It is awesome, it's good to help the New people out. We were all at this stage once, no matter how experienced we are now or whatever we were always in the position of being new to Counter Strike.  With the help of older players/more experienced it can give the "Noobs" off to an advantage.	I'm a male from Sydney, Australia, love playing games and i love learning about new things. I spend most of my time looking at CS:GO things, YouTube and learning about Medicine (Learning to be a Paramedic).  I've previously run one of Australia's biggest gaming communities on GMOD before it's closure.  I love listening to both sides of the story and finding out what started the argument or whatever it is i'm doing at the time.  I'm currently a Contributor on /r/GlobalOffensive and i wish to continue my work on that when i'm a moderator as well as doing my other chores to make sure this community runs as smoothly as possible. 	10-12 months	As long as i've been apart of the Global Offensive community it has been quite a positive experience. There have been many ups and downs, seeming as a lot of players are sick and tired of "Valve", they seem to bring all their anger to the Reddit and that's really the only complaint.   People new around here seem to think this Reddit is run by Valve themselves and assume that if they post here it will happen and get mad if it doesn't happen.
6/1/2015 0:52:01	http://reddit.com/user/gordomono	UTC-7	21	I've taken some beginner courses in python. Nothing too elaborate, I understand loops, recursive function, lists and other things you learned in beginning coding.	Can't say that I have ever been an admin for a server but I have an idea what it entails. From what I've heard from other admins from my dayz playing dayz it's a demanding jobs. You have to be able to judge when people are complaining for no reason and when people have a legitimate complaint. You have to be kind to people and make the right choice even when you don't want to. Own up to the mistakes that you make in admining. Maybe you banned someone without enough evidence since you really didn't like the individual. Ensure that you have just cause to take action against people. Banning people is not a particular fun thing to do but you have to do it or else the community will go into chaos. At least in dayz people assume that admins have way more power then they actually do. Lastly I know that there is a lot of  pettiness. It's your job as an admin to be above this. A good thing about being a potential mod for this subreddit is that you are not alone. You have a team of people that keep you in check and review your actions to ensure that you are not abusing your power.	I think that it's a way of interacting with the community and gives a chance for the community to get to know the mod. The community gets to know that the mods aren't just some faceless person but an actual individual. It also give people a chance to branch out from dust2 competitive and aid in the future of CS GO. The only way we can know if a map is good or not is by play testing it and bringing lesser known map to light.	Newbie Thursday is great for that fact it give new players and seasoned player a opportunity to ask question that would probably get ignored. There is always something to be learned. Maybe by reading the Newbie Thursday you learned something you didn't know before, some new smokes spots or some other thing like that. I learned from the last newbie Thursday a little bit more about the pro scene. That there are some binds not allowed in the pro scene. To me newbie Thursday is one of the best part about the community. It allows for the commonly asked questions to be found in a unified place instead of people posting the same questions constantly which allows for other content to get to the top of this subreddit.	I'm a 21 year old and from Oregon. Not sure if this is applicable but I'm fluent in Spanish. I've gotten into CS GO these past 6 months and I love the rush of adrenaline that get's to you when you are 1 v 1 and it's time to clutch. A great thing about this game is that you are not by yourself in this game. You have a team that with a common goal of winning. A little more about myself I'm currently in college studying biology since I love learning how the world works and how it intertwines with everything. I generally am on reddit since I have an addiction to this website. My main motivation for being a mod for this subreddit is that I feel emotionally invested in this game. In being a mod I'll get to learn the in and outs of this community and game. I'd say my weakest point about being an admin is my lack of knowledge of pro teams. I know your top team like NIP, fnatic, and TSM. A little bit about their history and that the pro scene has different rule but I'm not sure how they tie into their LOL counter-part or just e-sport in general. I'm aware of major tournament like ESEA or valve sponsored but the smaller scene I have no clue.  Thank you for reviewing my application and I hope to hear back from you. :-)	4-6 months	It's a a pretty nice community besides the mods getting paid off. Hopefully you get I'm kidding. People are generally nice the only problem is that people sometimes get a little elitist about their rank. There's not too much you can change about this since whenever there is a class system people are going to feel superior and diminish those below them. All you can do is ensure that they don't witch hunt those of lower ranks and make sure that they aren't being downright abusive. I personally haven't seen it but I'm sure that skins and gambling are a source of problem of this community since money is involve. Where ever there is money there are problems. As Notorious BIG said "mo money mo problem"
6/1/2015 0:58:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/Jaibosonic/	GMT-5	16	Basics of Java, no Web based code.	No		Seems great. Also reduces spam questions that are asked every day.	I think being a moderator would be very nice as I've always wanted to help out a community you are a part of. You always hear these horror stories of mods being power hungry and stuff, but i'd would be honored to be a part of the moderating team. While there are probably many people who claim to nice and can follow rules, I truly feel that I would try my best to follow and be a respectful mod. I'm not frequent poster in many subreddits I follow such as LoL and CSGO, Not because I'm not a invested person but because I am more passive on my views and don't like to get into arguments or discussions.	13-18 months	One of least toxic communities of any Game(ex. LoL, Dota) 
6/1/2015 1:15:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/steakmm/	GMT-5	26	Metamod and Sourcemod scripting, HTML.	Yes, I've hosted servers since 2001 for Counter-Strike and Sven-Coop. Fileservers/voip servers for my friends. I got Google Fiber a while ago and I'm willing to share my pipe.	It's great, I was happy about the 'adopt a silver' thread getting so much attention. I adopted two and one now outranks me, and they're both now people I regularly talk to.	I have not participated in any, but I love this game and as stated above I encourage newbies to learn.	Started young on TFC after reading an article on HL/TFC in PC Gamer. Have worked tech jobs and been a typical 90's kid. Mom was in car accident in 2009 forcing me to move back to my hometown to take care of her, so have time beyond these obligations and work. #1 fan of Alpine Sweat and Watah S'Good.  Thank you for your consideration and your time!	2-3 years	I started on TFC and CS back in 1999 and not much has changed. There will always be people who want to ruin your fun; there will always be the myg0t who want to just get a rise out of the crowd, but most people just want to enjoy the damn game :).
6/1/2015 1:30:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/rabbit01	UTC+10	23	I code in: HTML/CSS Javascript(Basic) PHP (Learning) Visual Basic Python	Yes I was an admin of one of the largest COD4 clans "Brothers in Arms" or =B][A= the server has since shutdown. My job is a systems admin and I have moderated Forums, Websites, Game servers (Cod4/Minecraft/Halo/Gmod).  Not that is really relevant for reddit I know how to virtualise and monitor servers (Load balancers/DNS/Game hosting) in both WIndows and Linux.  I'm guessing you would be looking for mods to double up on reddit & community servers in the future.	Not having had servers near Australia I haven't had much to do with it. I would love to get some local servers running in Australia for the scene down here. 128 tick, 5v5 etc. get some new maps going.	I'm going to talk about Newbie Thursday in the next question.	Where to start?  I'm a full time system admin for a healthcare company, I'm in charge of running the servers and developing websites/applications/processes and have a great deal of knowledge of administration.  I'm a gym rat but also love gaming, CSGO is my only current game i'm playing at the moment and most of my spare time goes into that. When i'm at work or on call i'm always browsing reddit and /r/globaloffensive and have had mod experience on reddit before.  I'm always contactable view emails/skype/steam for emergencies and enjoy being an admin for most things, its not a power trip thing I just enjoy helping out people, keeping things running smoothly and stopping trolls.  I do some graphic design and have a few professional friends if the sub ever needs work done in CSS/Art etc.	10-12 months	Our community has exploded, literally look at this growth chart: http://i.imgur.com/f1PTepW.png  That chart is months old but the trend hasn't stopped. With this growth inevitably comes new players and a great deal of those come to reddit. We have almost (or have) taken over dota 2 subreddit subs/viewers, we need to have threads like these to keep a lot of new threads down.  Look over at /r/fitness, they have a bunch of weekly threads "Gym story Saturdays, Nutrition Tuesdays etc." so I do believe more mods, more threads and more control is definitely needed.
6/1/2015 1:38:42	http://www.reddit.com/user/xtitomosquito	GMT-7	15	I made a website using Enjin's website editors. Other than that I don't have much experience with coding. Although I am gonna take computer science in the next year of school :)	I've never had experience with running or admining a CSGO server. Although I had experience with Minecraft and Teamspeak servers. Around the time that I was about 12-13 years old, I applied for a Minecraft server called "Pure Realms", I was recruited along 3 others as a helper. 2 months later I was promoted into a Moderator. I later resigned due to losing interest in playing. As for Teamspeak, I ran a League of Legends community that hosted daily tournaments. They ran about 5-9 PM every day. At the time the community was called Descendant Gaming and was a very small community. I joined from my brother playing in the tournaments. I applied to make them a website because honestly it was a REALLY bad website. Although I didn't have any experience with one but I thought it wouldn't be too hard. After looking through tutorials I made the website and it looked, if you say, "better". As a tech I was adored by the server owners and members because I was probably the youngest (14) and most mature. I was promoted to moderator because a few left due to personal issues. I became a Head Moderator quickly because of a lot of drama and almost every staff member being banned. The environment was pretty chill but it mainly revolved around our server owner (Was a girl) and tournaments. The server owner was very toxic and a lot of people, even the staff, hated her. Which put me in a position where either I do the same or just do my job and not worry about drama. I was asked to Co-Own the server and I gladly accepted. Weeks following the server owner left, I was made owner and a month later the server closed. (Sorry for being so long)	I see the posts being stickied at the top sometimes. I never joined one but I like the idea of community events. 	Its great for people around all ranks. I learned some stuff from it and its good to stay. 	I am 15 years old and come from a slightly large family (9 in total). I live in Southern California and sometimes awkward. I got into gaming when I was really young, I got an xbox when I was around 7 years old. A lot of people in my school and my cousin played Xbox so I spent a lot of time playing. I got my first glimpse of PC gaming when my brother spent hours playing Runescape and Counter Strike 1.6. At the time we had a really crappy computer. When I was 12 my brother bought PC parts off his friend and he built his own computer. I would watch him play Minecraft and League of Legends and I gained a lot of interest. Whenever I got back from school he would let me play for a couple of hours. When I was 14 I bought my first PC and built it with my brother. The main games I played was League of Legends and Minecraft until early 2014 I discovered CSGO. I played a few competitive games and was landed into Nova 3 then deranked into silver. I also found about reddit, my first sub-reddit was /r/lol and I spent a lot of time lurking and was intrigued by other subreddits. I then crept into /r/csgo. Currently I am an LEM with over 1k hours on CSGO. and a sophomore in high school (Junior in a few months) and looking to pursue computer science as a career, or something similar. I'm looking to go competitive in the near future. I'm also a big fan of esports, I watch a lot of League and CSGO tournaments. Used to be a decent bettor but quit due to being cleaned, although I fiddle with sites like Vulcun and Lounge from time to time. That's all, thanks! :)	7-9 months	People can be very critical and spoken about things (ESEA), I can see where their hates come from but a lot of it is unwarranted. Overall some of the same comments get annoying, i.e 10/10 shitpost, relevant shitpost etc... Sometimes instead of having actual comments in a thread it's usually spammed with memes. Although I don't mind them sometimes but when the top 10 comments are memes is when it's a bit annoying. But I guess it is what people like right? Also thanks for not being filled with drama like /r/lol  If someone in the community or mods would like to make match threads like /r/lol that would be cool, I've seen some on the front page but they're usually for big teams and big tournaments. Maybe more discussion will remove a lot of the low quality content that usually goes past the front page.
6/1/2015 1:59:35	https://www.reddit.com/user/NerfRengar/	GMT-4	18	Javascript/CSS/HTML basics from HS class	No	None	I think its useful and read through most of the threads. Although I dont post in it reading the questions normally makes me curious to see the answers and get a perspective from another player.	I am not a frequent poster but always have something to say about a topic. Being sort of unsocial in real life might have to do with my lack of comments so I want to find another way of being part of a community, especially one in which I am a huge fan. CSGO is a game that I play everyday and the reddit community is something  i want to be part of.	4-6 months	I think the community is growing around esports and betting and no longer growing around a love of CS or the game.. (if you get what I mean) I also think the subreddit specifically is too easy on Valve and the developers. I dont think CSGO is getting the attention it deserves but I guess I dont expect a riot outside the HQ for it. CS:GO is a great game and even if the growth is from a more negative source its still growth that leads to a better game and scene.
6/1/2015 2:09:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/Raaaaaaaaaaaaat/	GMT+1	25	bits of pieces of html, css, basic etc	nope	Community is what makes and breaks games. Gives us a common thought and goal (winning a match/round)   Also gets people off Reddit and into a match!	Sometimes questions/concerns are ignored over the voting of dank memes/twitter posts/gifs or match discussion/results.  A separate sub for example, CSGO4NEWBIES, wouldn't have the impact and potential supply of player help due to everyone sitting on the default /r/GlobalOffensive sub.  Encouraging meaningful discussion/help never hurts  	Male, 25 and happy to help pull out the weeds.  Every garden has weeds or even a few undesirable plants that don't follow the message of said garden.	4-6 months	Sane adults seem to run this sub. I say this in light of /r/leagueoflegends and a few other sub's internal events and such.  Also this rule makes me happy; We are not looking for people who are power-moderators looking for another sub to add to their list.  Only god knows how many "badges" people like to collect
6/1/2015 2:18:52	http://www.reddit.com/u/NheroArconix	GMT-6	14	Yes. Java/HTML, learning CSS.  I'm a programmer on my highschool's FRC team. (FIRST Robotics Competition) We program robots in Java, and teach the new members each year. (I was among said new members this year.)  Took a year-long class in HTML/Web Design at school this year. Unfortunately it was pretty outdated and easy, nothing too challenging. We did touch CSS a little, but nothing that noticeable. I can understand/read parts of it but I'm still learning a lot.	Not CS:GO, but I used to be the head admin a MineCraft/TTT server a while ago, if that matters. They didn't get much activity but I did have to deal with trollers/greifers quite a few times.	It seems like a fun way to try out new CS:GO maps. Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to join in any, but I would if I was able to.  I have participated in subreddit community nights before, and they're a ton of fun, but none of these were CS related.	It's a great resource to help out newer players on reddit. Just simply reading the thread helped me learn, considering that I got placed at silver 1. (I'm currently MG2 c:)	I'm a MtF transgender that's pre-everything and not open to my family yet. I can be a little sensitive about it at times but don't get offended easily. Just wanted to get that out of the way first.  Anyways - Hi! I'm NheroArconix. And I suck at introductions/talking about myself. Sorry about that. Most of these paragraphs are probably shorter then I think they are.  I'm (currently, Birthday's on june 8th) 14, although I have been told on MANY occasions that people think I'm older. (Got told by a friend from elsewhere that they thought I was 20 recently.) I spend a good majority of time either gaming, on reddit/forums, or watching anime or YouTube videos. As a highschool student I have a lot of free time, especially now because of summer vacation.  I'm also a moderator of /r/townofsalemgame, a rather small subreddit (Roughly 1300~ unique visitors per day, 3500~ subs) that's currently growing. As the title would imply, it's the subreddit for the game Town of Salem. There's currently 4 mods for the subreddit, myself included. I'm still learning there, and trying to get some more community opinions on what they want from the subreddit. I mostly rely on reports and what people are talking about, since we rarely get modmail. Being a mod of /r/GlobalOffensive would help me out there, but if I don't get accepted I'm just glad I applied in the first place, still a learning experience for me.  I try to get on everyone's good side, and if anyone has a problem with me or my actions I'm very open to criticism. I tend to base my life around improvement. All my favorite games are very skill-based (CS:GO, Town of Salem, osu!, and Dark Souls to name a few), for a start there, and I enjoy learning new things.  I'm also an INFJ-Type personality. I suck at explaining it, but in a nutshell it means that I can be extremely passionate about anything. This can also backfire as I tend to burn myself out a lot and am a bit of a perfectionist. I can also be a little irrational sometimes when something goes against my thoughts. I'd recommend this if you want to know more, but considering the amount of applications I'm sure flood in it's alright if you skip over it. http://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality (Also, insert a "I am the 1% joke here because <1% of the population has this personality.)  As much as I want to say more here nothing comes to mind at the moment, thanks for considering my application. <3	4-6 months	I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to answer this question. It feels like it always has for my time reading it, with it just being a large community it's hard to tell sometimes.   
6/1/2015 2:20:44	http://reddit.com/u/ehe9501	UTC-8	14	Taking an intro to java course in school, thats it. 	I'm mod on a twitch stream, but I don't think that counts.	Never did it since busy with school, but it seems like a cool and fun idea to have fun as a community. 	Had no idea that existed. 	Currently a freshman at a highschool, I frequently play CSGO with friends, I have social anxiety. Built my own PC, helped friends build theirs as well, also play video games a lot. Also not trying to put myself out there but I'm a nice guy. :)	4-6 months	Majority are nice people, some people are really mean, others bully people because of their rank. 
6/1/2015 2:27:33	http://reddit.com/u/caty111	GMT+1	14	Very small amount of HTML and Python. ( I mean small ;)	-	I wish I've taken part in one. They look great.	-	Loving CS:GO after being introduced to it by /u/exitc0de. MG1-2 hovering around those ranks at the moment. Quite active on reddit spending around 1.5 hours reading every morning and afternoon on bus. (How I found this). Never been a mod on any subreddit before but are willing to do my best!  /u/caty111	4-6 months	I've found this subreddit useful in finding information, pro news but haven't noticed many bad threads or moderator influence probably due to the fear job they aleady do.
6/1/2015 2:27:33	https://www.reddit.com/user/barcode7845/	GMT+10	17	No.	I have hosted a lot of inhouses (10 mans). Experienced in eBOT, plugins (sourcemod and metamod). Know a lot of CSGO cvars command by heart.	No.	Great way to promote and allow questions to be asked, puts forward the importance of assisting players (at all levels) in CSGO thus improving the community and growth.	Quite a lurker on other subreddits, love scanning new posts for people who need help urgently. Not a single day (since the beginning I've visted this subreddit) that I have no checked /r/GlobalOffensive Live in Australia, and I have the syndrome to always click to this subreddit which is bookmarked (chrome). Can't live a day without some CSGO. Huge e-Sports follower (GO NiP!) Not affected by people calling me out (aka shit talking)  Thank you very much for reading my application, Looking forward to hearing from you guys ;) 	13-18 months	I really like the the community, Artworks get upvoted, Montages are upvoted, just in general people who have posted their work are not ignored; I really like the attitude here. When I first checked this subreddit I definitely appreciated the CSGO update posts, and the comments of possible bugs and ninja updates.  Overtime this subreddit has evolved from being a "LFT" to a community which loves CSGO related content. 
6/1/2015 2:51:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/xGG_Cayden/	UTC+10	15	Unfortunately not. Sorry	Not specifically Admin, but I have moderated a couple of servers, one of them was a surf server, which had quite a few players come through and that required a lot of attention but eventually it died down and they shut down.   I also was staff on a 1v1 arena server but they let me go due to inactivity (I went on holidays and failed to notify them)	All sounds pretty sweet to me, I don't really have much of an opinion though.	I believe it can be extremely helpful to the new players considering when I was fairly new I wished there was something I had when I first joined CS:GO it would have been extremely helpful, I feel joyed and pride myself in knowing I'm apart of such a great community.	Me, I am not a nerd I am only daily for hours but I also have sport commitments, I am a very hard worker as long as I have an interest in it, CS:GO is the only game I play and have for a while.   I started playing in Source, and picked up CS:GO maybe a year ago which I have continued to enjoy, My rank is MG1 (Inb4 Meme Master) but so I can help anyone lower than my rank in whatever they need.  I can be very loquacious at times which isn't always a bad thing, I am very laid back but that doesn't mean I slack I take many things serious as long as they are to be taken that way, I love to have a joke around and keep the mood light, I appreciate the time you guys have put in to read this application. Have a good day Sincerely,   Cayden. 	4-6 months	Well, being honest I think it's a great success I haven't been here the longest time which makes me only have one thought on the community, It hasn't changed from where I first arrive, I love the things people post and they range from serious topics to funny which I enjoy sifting through daily.  There is rarely and flame from what I see which brings me to the conclusion that the community is far from toxic, but always helpful.
6/1/2015 3:32:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/shishasheik	GMT+1	26		Yes in 1.6 - not in GO though.	Very good indeed, although I've never participated myself. I think the idea of gathering the whole community, who comes from all skill levels is very rewarding to the sub and community in whole. You can use all concepts and themes, whatever the community feels like.	The classic one. Everyone can get better, so this thread shouldn't just focus on newbies, but on all players. Everyone can evolve and adapt their playstyle and knowledge. My impression is that it's already all skill levels who are using these threads, as they are very informing.	26 years old living in Denmark.  Played cs 1.6 before Go for several years. So I've played CS for about 15 years in total. Rank is global elite.  I spent a lot of time playing cs with my mates being all types of ranks. I like to educate new players and discuss the gameplay. That's also why I use the subreddit.  I work as an it specialist and mostly handle our antivirus, vmware environment and other stuff.	10-12 months	Mostly useful stuff, but thread spam like olofpass, flusha cheats etc. is not good for the community.  I would really like to participate in the development of the community.
6/1/2015 3:33:01	https://www.reddit.com/user/s1eger/	GMT+2	27	HTML, CSS, JAVA  I do front-end design, and web design. So Im not the best in these languages, but I have experience.	Yes I do have, I am helping donanımhaber forums, so I do help them and also I am owner of some servers on prooyuncu.com who has one of the highest ratings on csgo community servers.	-	There can be some parts for newb traders, newb players, computer tweak guides, which I can help about.	I am middleman for donanımhaber which has around 1000active posts daily. In normal life I am an architect, and I do front-end designs. I have masters degree from NY, USA then I moved to Turkey around 11 months ago, and since then Im trying to help new players, mostly about trading scams.   And I am a player who won 2002 WCG Turkey. So Its been really long time since I have entered this community.	7-9 months	
6/1/2015 3:54:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/bysam	GMT+2	15	I know Python and C# decently, but I doubt I will be effective making anything good.	I have not done too much in-game adminstrating, I used to admin a Battlefield 3 server for a short amount of time however. I do however have experience administrating forums and communities.  http://covert-games.com is one of them.	I have unfortunately only participated in Community Night once, and that was when we playtested de_zoo. And it was a LOT of fun. I'd love to help administrating Community Night's as well if you need help with that.	I'm going to be honest, I don't visit the NT threads alot, even though I wish I did. However I think it's a great idea and I will start visiting it a lot more often as I see no reason not too, and helping people is always fun.	Wel, my name is Samuel (prefer to be called Sam, though). I live in Sweden and am 15 years old. Ever since my brother introduced me to Starcraft 2 when I was 11 I've been hooked on esport. And I basicly live for it and plan on working with it, it's such an amazing new thing and I badly want to be apart of it.   I have great knowledge of esport scene and I do volunteer work for arena.network and adminstrate various esport facebook groups. I'm also working together with my local esport scene. See: orebroesport.se  Outside of esport I'm quite the nerd; love math, science, space and robots. I like Hong Kong's culture and have visited it once in the past. I have also visited every swedish Dreamhack since 2011.  I am lucky for having it easy in school and despite almost not studying I got top grades, so I have a lot of time for adminstrating, reading and ofcourse watching esports.  I have been lurking on Reddit for about 3 years and am very familiar with how it works.  Oh, I only drink Pepsi and love to eat chili.   Hope I can get this chance to work with you guys in one of the biggest esport communities, Sam	2-3 years	I belive /r/GlobalOffensive currently is too much circlejerking and complaining, I get it, I really do. Im a an avid CS and Dota fan and we're not getting nearly as much recognizion as we would be getting if we had another developer. But CONSTANTLY complaining about it, in every post, is annoying. Now I won't ban anyone for it, but it's my opinion.  Now to opinions, I'm a man of strong opinions, and I like to express them, and whenever I say something that Reddit doesn't agree to, I get -10 downvotes and I belive it mutes alot of the community alot, this I think has to change, and is actually against the reddiquette. The downvote button is not a "I do not agree button" and this I think we should enforce.  I also belive we have too many gfycats of gameplay clips. These are cool every now and then, maybe put them all in a megathread or something? But atleast when I go on Reddit I want to discuss, watch gameplay I can do on YouTube. /r/GlobalOffensive used to be a lot more discussion and I really liked it that way, if you don't remember you can check out the WayBack Machine archive and have a look.  
6/1/2015 4:04:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheRandomWolf/	GMT+3	13	A little lua and a little C# also really a bit of HTML	I have made private servers for me and friends to play but I couldn't port open them to be public	I haven't got to play it yet unfortantely	I love it! I'm glad it exists as it is very helpful for new players and a chance for better and more experienced players to help.	I'm in middle school, soon in 9th grade, I spend a lot of my time gaming and writing stories, and of course browse reddit a lot I visit /r/GlobalOffensive more than once a day and I really like it here seeing as the community is really nice. I've been gaming ever since about the age of 6-7 when my brother first showed me video games, I used to play more casually back then of course.	4-6 months	I don't know much about the current mods, haven't seen them a lot, but it seems the subreddit is pretty much clean of spam so I'd say they're doing their job well.
6/1/2015 4:15:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/jfm32/	GMT+1	22		The only real server admin/FTP work I've done is on practice servers, hosted by Ckras, for my team. 	I think they are brilliant, they're a good way to meet new people, and to play new and classic maps in a good environment	It offers a chance for people to ask questions they may otherwise be shut down for asking. Anything like this I really like, the reason a lot of people come to this sub-reddit is to learn tips and tricks for CS:GO and I always find a lot of these offered in this thread.	I've played Counter-Strike since 2005, starting with Source and moving onto CS:GO. I take the game quite seriously, and currently play at quite a decent level, and rising, CEVO Main and ESEA Intermediate. I work full-time 8-4:30, but always have access to a computer, and loads of free time to browse Reddit, of course :)	19-24 months	It can be very circle-jerk, for example we love to get behind teams like Vox and Kinguin, I guess we love an underdog story. There's a lot of fluff posts, but I guess that comes with the size of the sub-reddit. There's also always new tips and tricks to pick up, people theorycrafting and coming up with new smokes/flashes and things to look out for. Overall I think the community is really enthusiastic and helpful.
6/1/2015 4:27:30	http://reddit.com/user/Coolyou	GMT+2	19	Yes, I have a big knowledge in the following languages: CSS and HTML. I know it's not a lot but I used to learn it and stylize my forums, sites and such. I might start learning JavaScript soon, but that's not my priority at the moment.	Well, I never hosted a CS: GO servers, but I had a community with CS 1.6 servers and been owner for 3 years. So yes, I had a lot of knowledge about server-side files and amx modx edits and so on. Since I'm a quick-learner, I could learn anything related to CS: GO admining if needed.	I currently have nothing special on my mind related to Community Night content, but I believe it's a great way to interact with the community.	One of the best way to help out new players and newcomers to this subreddit to learn more about this game and give them tips to see how things works around here. So I strongly support this idea of having "Newbie" threads.	Let make it simple and clean.  I'm coming from Serbia, I'm 19 years old. My name is Mario and currently I'm a student who has lot's of free time, therefore I decided to try my best and apply here on reddit to be a helper. I played CS 1.6 since I was 10 years old, when CS GO beta appeared I decided that it's time to move on and start my journey on this new masterpiece game. I'm playing only competitive, if you ask for rank I'm ranked as LEM (I intend to improve, but always solo-queueing so it's not so easy as it looks). My experience with moderation - I have been a moderator on Gametracker.com for years ( http://www.gametracker.com/coolyou/ ), but I decided to retire a year ago, also I had a moderator on few more communities, but overall, you can say I'm very experienced with moderating and I can be mature, cold headed, responsible, and able to work as an individual or in a group.   If you have some question, don't hesitate to ask.	3-4 years	I have been here since it had around 200-300 people online, always as a lurker and always had a lot of things to see and useful stuff on how to improve my gaming experience. This was the first time I started using a reddit, but never been active for lack of time or something like that. I created an account, especially to upvote interesting things here and bookmark them and since then till now a lot of things have changed. I don't think there is anything bad about mods to be told in truth, they are humans and they use their free time to help people which they don't know, so let's respect that.
6/1/2015 4:58:53	http://reddit.com/u/Kr4zeE	UTC-6	21	No	I used to host and admin a server back in CS:Source.	None	None	I've been playing Counter strike for 6 years. I have made plenty of suggestions via reddit to valve and they even implemented some of them. I have quite a few prominent members of the counter strike community on my friends list on steam including casters and professional players and I myself am pretty well known in the scene. I am unbiased when it comes to almost everything so you won't see me admin abusing anytime soon. I also check the CS:GO reddit on an hourly basis. I think I would be a great mod to take the workload off of the current mods working.	13-18 months	They are interesting to say the least.
6/1/2015 5:04:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/KarmaOfPain/	GMT-7	18	No	I am currently one of the Head admins of a CSGO community called Hellsgamers. We currently have 12 CSGO servers which range from DM servers to Minigames servers. I deal with abuse reports, ban reports, drama of any sort, and making sure everyone is having a good time. 	I think it is a great way to interact with the community.	I think it is a really good tool for new players wanting to get good at this game.	I am a College student who enjoys playing video games. I am known for being a very calm person. I rarely lose my cool since I know how to control my emotions very well. I like to play sports such as baseball and basketball. I use to watch pro baseball and basketball everyday but ever since eSports has been growing, I prioritize those matches. I keep up more with the pro CSGO scene more than any other sport. That is pretty much all! 	13-18 months	Overall, this community has a lot of helpful and funny people in it. We have a very friendly environment for people trying to improve in CSGO. This subreddit has grown a lot since the first CSGO major and it continues to grow! 
6/1/2015 5:09:29	http://www.reddit.com/user/cl0ud_cs/	GMT+0	21	No, Nothing that serves any use anyway. 	I hosted (as well as paid for extra servers from Multiplay) a set of servers which were part of a community I helped initiate and was a part of for a couple of years. This was on Counter Strike: Source. scoutzknives, DM, gungame, minigame. Many frequence and concurrent players over time, dozens of admins over all the server. Was a good time :) Was called |INC| Gaming - some of long standing members admin the steam group and play CS:GO. But I'm not really active with them anymore.   About to host a server or 2 (in EU) for launders. /u/csboxr - one of his top donators (twitch username: zeaL_tv) and been watching his YT / stream since the beginning pretty much.   	Think it's a great idea, some of us more frequent users have actually become good friends and a few of us play other games here and there or have played in other 10 mans together since :)   Playtests are also a great thing too, I actually really enjoy being a part of giving REAL / valuable feedback on a new map under development. What better way to instigate better chemistry within discussion about a certain game other than playing it with each other?	None besides the fact it's a fantastic way for people to have light shed on anything they want each week, even by just reading the thread itself. I myself have learnt a lot just from browsing it.	My name is Jonnie Milton,  I'm 21 years old, live in South-East London, United Kingdom. I work full time, but might possibly be able to get a position at Twitch as sales operations manager (fingers crossed) - that's my current motive for work. I'm a musician & audio enthusiast by hobby, that's my main passion a long with gaming & eSports.  I have a team on CS:GO, all within the UK. We're still finding our feet and play mostly for fun - but will hopefully attend LANs together this year!   I've played HL, Quake and UT2004 in the past.. pretty much what got me into cs right after I saw my cousin playing 1.6, so I used to use his account to plug countless hours into it! Got my own steam account 7 or so years ago & bought CS:S. Since getting into CS:GO & having my own team and being a part of a couple of communities / streams I can safely say counter strike is one of my main hobbies & interests.  Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nautilus-zeaL	10-12 months	I feel like with it's exponential growth as a subreddit, throughout the majors especially, has proven how that amplifies the kind of posters and lack of coherence to the rules of the subreddit. Totally understandable why you guys would need all the help you can get from thorough mods - I personally have nothing negative to say about the current mods, from what I've seen they've been very diligent with their role & purpose.   Of course... it's like anything really, with it's growth in subscribers, it brings a lot more chaos to the table. But I believe the right set of moderators can keep that in order. The community will reflect the way it is with counterstrike and the game as one of the largest eSports in the world now. My personal opinion is that the community overall has suffered from the monetizing of the game (skins, therefore betting... etc) but obviously the game and the major tournaments has greatly benefited.
6/1/2015 5:19:04	http://reddit.com/user/neocool99	GMT+3	16	I did a tiny bit of HTML and CSS	No		It really helped when I first started playing and is still helpful at times. If anything it would be nice to keep it going all the time.	I have a little bit of an interesting story if I do say so myself. I was born in the US, but when I was a year and half old I moved to Venezuela. I lived there for 8 years. From there I moved to Tanzania where I lived for 5 years. Now I live in Israel and will probably graduate high school here. I move so much because my parents teach at international schools. I'm in tenth grade. I think I'm a really balanced person. I play sports, I play video games, I go out with friends, and I keep good/ok grades.	7-9 months	I haven't been active for that long but /r/GlobalOffensive is my favorite subreddit along with /r/PCMasterrace. It's a really great place to see what community issues are and express your own. It would be nice if we knew if Valve is looking at the subreddit. I know, that's crazy.
6/1/2015 5:20:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/isak69/	GMT+1	15	I have some experience in HTML and C++	When I was 11 I made my own minecraft server 8-) 	Thats some great banter	Thats some great banter	I live with my parants and I have a dog called Mira. She is a poodle. I like trampoline and sometimes I eat food during the night. 	4-6 months	Thats some great banter

Also i have made a free website once	i was once home at my uncle	i like nights cause they are dark	newbs need to get alife	i am a cool easy to be around 11 year old from denmark. I like to play cod while i drink doritos and eat mtn dew while I scream i bang your mom. 	5+ years	its kinda cool but the current mods suk ass
6/1/2015 5:37:09	http://www.reddit.com/user/Nerret	UTC+1	19	Yes, im currenly in the end of my first year of web intergration. (3 years in total). I currenly have expereince with html/css/jqury/php and since i have 2 years left ill learn a lot of new and cool stuff :)	I do not.	I think its a fun idear to help the community get in touch	I think its awesome! New players often dont have a place to ask questions with out getting bashed and it seems like newbie thursday threads are filled with nice people willing to help a newbie out!	My name is Peter, better known online as Nerret.   Im 19 years old and live in Denmark and im currenly in school studying web intergration (the codeing of web sites).   I started useing reddit about 2 years ago and have been active ever since. Ive been a member of the over all gaming community for about 10 years when i first started playing World of warcraft. A game i still play to this day  I started playing CS:GO around 1 months ago when a freind of my asked me to play with him. Super fun, and ive been haveing a blast ever since.   When im not doing homework or when im not at school i spend around 50% of my time with one eye on reddit, always looking for new cool stuff.   Other then that im a pretty normal person, doing daily things in my daily life.	0-3 months	I think its alright, if id have to grade it prob a B+ My problem with the people in the sub is mostly that every once in a while a super cocky person will come along and for some reason get lots of upvotes. I get that its not really something you can do anything about.   Other then that i find it to be a nice place where you can come and speak your mind about the game and share cool things you find :)
6/1/2015 5:40:07	http://reddit.com/u/Nor_Skruf	GMT+1	17	Some, but not much at all. I am slightly familiar with HTML and Javascript.	I used to be an active moderator/admin on some Gmod servers a while back (3 servers) and some minecraft servers/communities, nothing huge, but some small servers with an average of 10 players per day. I even achieved Co-Owner on one of them, which at the time was a huge achievement. I do believe I was 13/14 at the time.	I have to be honest here, and I'm not familiar with Community Night.	Yet again I'm not too familiar with this. Although I'm now interested in knowing what they are.	Oh dear, I'm not the kind of person whom can give an opinion about myself without being worried about my thoughts being judged, I don't know why it's like this, but I've always had issues talking about myself, regardless, here goes nothing: My name is Sebastian, I'm a 16* year old Norwegian male, 1.86cm tall, rather skinny and have few interests. I play CS:GO for fun and am generally uninterested in the ranks, regardless of that I'm currently MGE. Other hobbies include Reading, Movies and GFX(not as much into GFX as I used to be.) I'm generally new to Reddit, but I feel as if I understand how it works, I do NOT however have any experience on being a staff member of a sub-reddit, so if I do get picked, hopefully someone can take 5 minutes to give me an introduction.    *I put my age as 17 because I'm 17 this year and explain it here because I'm not sure how official documents are filed in your country, but in Norway we input our age as the one we will turn the relevant year.	0-3 months	I like it, although it does have it's problems, but then again, so does every community, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and should not be judged from a personal point of view. The community seems to be friendly most of the times, and as long as that's the case, I have nothing against it. Everyone can be frustrated and say/type things they don't generally mean or gave much thought to, and shouldn't instantly be disregarded as a resonable individual as a result. Much like overwatches, one instance proves nothing, but multiple instances will create an impression that's hard to get rid of.
6/1/2015 5:53:44	http://www.reddit.com/user/SamEnzoo	GMT+1	21	Just a little HTML, not much though.	Our team Captivated Gaming hosts it's own server for practice and scrimming, it's hosted on Azure.	I haven't really participated as of yet.	Same as the above.	I am a young IT technician, who is studying to become a Network Administrator. I play Counter-strike daily with my team, and we attend as much LAN's together as possible. I'm aware of all the popular topics on this subreddit and enjoy browsing through the comments, although i'm not active myself.	19-24 months	This is by far the most enjoyable subreddit i've been on. 
6/1/2015 5:54:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/deadxilence/	GMT-7	16	Some Java, 1 semester of high school introduction to Java, most of which I have forgotten by now.	Yes. I adminned on the Slayers Gaming Trade Server for over half a year. It was an open lobby for trading so a lot (60+ slots) of people would come in and advertise their items and it was my job to make sure nobody was spamming, talking over each other, and that people were respectful and efficient with their ads. 	I think its awesome to see that even in the broken and fragmented CS:GO community people can unite to play together and chill on cool maps. It's nice to see people who want to bring others together in a fun game of CS:GO, without a lot of excess faff.	I think its super helpful and hey I might even use it a bit now as I didn't know of it before. It is a great environment to ask questions and get REAL answers from REAL players with REAL evidence. Its just a win win for everyone involved and the upvotes on each comment are clear evidence of such. It's unique and awesome to see something like this happening.	I am in high school in Colorado currently. I used to trade a lot of skins but now I am looking to cash out and put some money in the bank. I like playing FPS shooters but I don't see myself as the best at them, but c'est la vie (as is life). I am learning Spanish in school and like cars too, especially Subarus. I hate seeing toxic and unkind communities so one thing I want to do is make an environment that people actually want to be in; something people love to be a part of. 	13-18 months	I think it is one of the best subreddits around, from sharing fragmovies to troll clips to news, its THE hub for all stuff CS:GO-related. Its a good way to ask questions, get feedback on content, or come to waste some time by looking at tutorials or trolling videos. I think it is a generally good community showcasing some of the best people, players, and ideas CS:GO has to offer, without a lot of bad stuff along with it.
6/1/2015 5:59:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/Skorp/	GMT+1	29	Yes, I'm a web developer by trade. I'm currently working on a personal project for CSGO, using Meteor as a platform (Node.js). By day, I create and manage e-commerce websites in PHP (Magento).	I've had a server in 1.6. Can't say I'm very experienced managing one, since it was mostly out of curiosity that I bought one. I played around with it, but not to a great length of expertise. It wasn't a public server so it had no community.	I love the idea. All projects that promote interaction between the community are welcome in my book. Not only you get to meet new people, but you also create a real sense of community that make people enjoy their time in the subreddit, as opposed to the "just a website" mentality.	Also a good idea. It's not a new one, most subreddits I frequent have some kind of "Ask newbie questions here". It's one of the most successful type of threads every time it's posted (in regards to comments, not upvotes), and I'll almost always learn something from them while browsing it. 	I'm Pedro, from Portugal. 29 year old guy working as a webdev in a portuguese company. My job is pretty relaxed in regards to what I should be doing and when, so I have a lot of free time to just browse reddit and see what's up in the world. I love football and soccer (weird huh?), but eSports will always have a place in my heart (specially CS).  CS as always had a big influence in my life. I failed two years in school just because I missed classes to play some 1.5 in the nearest lan center. Those were the days! Since GO picked up momentum I've always tried to follow the professional scene by watching games. I love how the game has grown I my wish for it is to have it televised some day, just like soccer and football. I believe we're on the right track, but it will take sometime for the world to accept eSports as a real sport. Mostly due to the mentalities of our older generation.  I never really know what to put in this section (about myself), so if you have any questions feel free to ask away.	19-24 months	First and foremost, honestly, it's the best CSGO community around. Albeit that's not saying much, because all most Counter Strike communities tend to be really toxic and trollish (hltv for intance). Reddit has the advantage of comment votes, so you don't notice those trolls so much in this subreddit, but they are still there if you browser long enough. But that's ok, there will always be trolls, just as long as they don't get much visibility, they'll eventually stop, as it's attention they're looking for.  In regards to content, it could use more competitive content, like match threads (there's been a few post match threads popping up lately, but that's not enough imo). I'd like to be able to discuss an ongoing game via reddit-stream just like I do in /r/nfl or /r/soccer. I realize this couldn't be done for all games (there are just too many), but perhaps a criteria could be found and a bot created to automatically post new match threads and let the community decide the visibility of it (via votes). 
6/1/2015 6:19:04	http://www.reddit.com/user/SynthhInHD	GMT+0	17	Yes. I'm fairly fluent in HTML and CSS, know a decent amount of Python, and am currently learning C++. I've also learned a bit of Java.	Yes, but not on CSGO. I have not been admin on any CSGO servers, mainly because I am not interested in doing so. It takes way too long to get into a community, get to know everyone, make myself known and then apply. I'd rather just play. :p A list of previous staff positions I have held can be found here: http://pastebin.com/0V6Lthup	I think it's good for staff to get involved with the community.	Never taken part in it, so I cannot say anything.	My name is James M. and I'm a seventeen year old teenager from Uppsala, Sweden. I've lived in the United Kingdom for most of my life. Me and my family moved to the UK in 1999. I was born on the 21st of September in 1997. I have a brother and he is 27 years old. My interests include (and I will explain them further), but are not limited to, Gaming, Music, Sport (mainly Football (the English kind, not hand-egg)), learning new things that interest me and women, of course.  Gaming: Gaming has been a part of my life since I was young(er). I started gaming at the tender age of 8, playing Club Penguin and a game called "Boxhead"; A co-op, round-based zombie killing game. Me and a friend played this a lot of the time he was at my house. He then introduced me to the well-known game RuneScape. I loved it the first time I saw it and I've loved it since (however I don't agree with some of the updates). I've played for nearly 7 years and I still play to this day, however some may question my legitimacy. In 2007, my father bought me a PlayStation 3 (the fat one) and a game that was recently developed then, called "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune". I spent countless hours on this new technology of mine and my games collection continued to grow, with my second game being Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. I did, however, have some anger issues whilst playing the games (and you may call me a stereotypical console player) and my father ended up destroying my console. He did, however, end up purchasing me a new one in 2009 and I still have that one to this day. In 2011 I bought myself an Xbox 360 Elite from my friend (at an overpriced rate, might I add) and I started purchasing games for that. Then, at Christmas in the year 2012, my lovely father purchased me brand new computer (Alienware x51) and I'm still using it. I'm using the same keyboard and computer that I got in 2012. My Steam library is now in excess of one hundred games.  Music: Music has been a part of my life for even longer than Gaming has. My father first introduced me to Pink Floyd, Santana, The Pixies and other similar bands and that is where my love for music grew. I inherited my mother's old classical guitar and started to teach myself, as well as receiving lessons for guitar at school for a year or two. At Christmas in 2006 I got my first electric guitar (I had a choice; a computer or an electric guitar and whichever I didn't choose, my brother would get, so he got the computer). I still have that very same guitar. After being asked to stop having lessons at school, I turned to a musical institution in Bishop's Stortford in the UK for lessons. I had lessons with a band of adults for a year and I also performed to a live audience in the Chelmsford Town Hall, along with my band. That was also the first time that I played the bass guitar. Drums was also an interesting feature of music to me, and my parents recognised my aptness and rhythmic abilities for music and so started to get me drum lessons at the same institution. They then bought me my very own bass guitar, an Ibanez bass guitar, and a bass amp as well as a micro-cube amp and some drumsticks. Later on in my musical "career" they purchased me a drum kit and I kept learning. They ended up selling that one and then buying me an electric drum kit, as it was getting more use than the acoustic drum kit. In mid 2013, I was in a drum lesson and they bought me a keyboard (Yamaha PSR-E433), which resides next to my electric drum kit behind me. I still have drum lessons to this day and my teacher tells me I am at a Grade Six standard.  Sport: As with music, sport has always been a favourable hobby for me and I've always been considered "better than average" at the majority of sports. I started off playing Football (soccer) for the local team 10 years ago. I played as a Striker, and to be quite honest our team was terrible. As the years progressed, I changed teams several times and ended up moving to another local team. Almost every player from that same team and I still play together (there are just a few people who left/stopped playing completely). We were always "average" and we never won anything. Then, our club's Youth section was closed so that the club could focus on adult football. We were forced to move to one of the other local clubs and were given our own "team". That was roughly two years ago, and now we are top of our league and we have not lost a single match in the league to date. If we continue as we are (with 7 games to go) we will win the league and bag ourselves our first trophy. BUT, that is not the first thing we've won. In late 2013 my team (not me, I didn't play as I was away on holiday) won a 5-aside tournament and we were all very proud. Football isn't the only sport I'm good at. I've represented my school in the Rugby A Team too. I remember distinctly winning one game approximately fifty to nil. I've also represented my school in the county athletics tournaments. I was representing them in the 100m sprint, the 100m relay and the high jump. My best time in the 100m sprint is 12.6 seconds and my personal record for high jump is 165cm - 20cm shorter than me. My school has come first in most of the county athletics tournaments.  Learning: Now, I know what you may be thinking: He likes learning? Must be a nerd. Not at all. I feel that everybody should have a curiosity about the world. Some people don't, which is a shame, but those who do are more intelligent anyway. I enjoy learning about things that interest me. These things include, but are not limited to, Coding, Gaming, Cars, Physics, Maths and amongst others/more generally, technology. I've always, according to my father, been interested in how the world works and nothing so far has changed about my attitude towards the world and its physics. At the moment I'm studying Computing, Geology and Double BTEC IT. If I succeed at this level of education, I'll be moving to Sweden, more specifically Uppsala (where I already own an apartment), to study Software Engineering or an equivalent course. Currently I'm being taught/teaching myself Python, C++, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, PHP, Visual.Basic and I plan on learning MySQL, Java (started but dropped it) and possibly some others.	0-3 months	I think it can be toxic at times, and I'm also an offender in regards to that, but in the end the majority of the players are friendly and easy-going and get along well together.
6/1/2015 6:25:06	http://reddit.com/user/CookieTheEpic/	GMT+2	17			Community Night is a great way to not only playtest maps from the community that seem promising, but to also bring the community together and offer a great way to play competitive Counter-Strike without being afraid of having toxic or otherwise unpleasant teammates.		My name is Miro, I'm 17 years old and I'm from a small town about 30 kilometres outside of Turku, Finland.  I've been playing Counter-Strike on and off for almost ten years now. CS 1.6 was the first online game I ever played and I still have fond memories of simply running around and shooting at other players or bots. Since the launch of Global Offensive, I've started to take the game more seriously, and now Counter-Strike is back to being my go-to shooter.  Outside of Counter-Strike, I'm a pretty outdoorsy guy, although I definitely don't look or sound like it, and I enjoy spending time in the beautiful Finnish nature. In about a year I will hopefully start studying for a degree in multimedia production, which in my case would include video and audio editing, as well as other production work such as upholding sets and operating camera and microphone equipment.  I'd like to think I'm pretty friendly and easily approachable, which has helped me to make friends overseas -- particularly in the US to where I will hopefully travel next year. These friends -- along with all forms of media -- have helped me become extremely fluent in English. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I speak English just as well as any US or UK native.  Interests outside of Counter-Strike and multimedia production include technology, food, vehicles of all nature and movies. I try to devote as much of my time as I can to all of my hobbies, as most of these I share with close friends.  I hope I've been wordy enough, it's never been easy for me to talk about myself :D  Big thanks to the moderation team not only for reaching out to the community members for help, but also for actually doing a bloody good job at moderating the subreddit. Whether or not I've sparked your interest, I wish to one day be half as good as you guys are at community management :D	10-12 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is very good for its size. There are definitely some bad apples and the occasional circlejerk et cetera, but overall it is very possible to have a conversation about the game, share tips and new content relating to the game. The subreddit is also my go-to location for patch notes and information on what has been added to the game with each update.
6/1/2015 6:27:03	http://reddit.com/user/hanzo1504	UTC+2	21	Only HTML, but I'm willing to learn.	Me and a couple friends had a 10 slot CS:S server running for 5on5 wars, we're looking forward to get that going again soon!	It's certainly a wonderful idea, unfortunately I wasn't able to attend one yet :-(.	It's a great idea aswell! As a former WoW player and lurker of /r/wow I know how helpful this can be for new players and even for seasoned ones.  There's always something new you can learn, and here questions can be asked where you don't need to worry about being called a "noob" and whatnot.	Well, obviously I'm not a native speaker. I can speak and understand English very well, but sometimes I make sentences sound a bit weird. I believe it's just a matter of getting used to it.  Anyways, I'm from Austria, so I speak German and English. I'm 21 years old and I'm an enthusiastic gamer. Counter Strike is what fuelled my passion for eSports, maybe because I'm quite the competitive kind of person and I'm pretty meh at real life sports, hehe :-).  I haven't played CS 1.6 that much because I was still quite young back then, but CS:S is where it all started. All my friends started playing the game because of me. I've put hundreds and hundreds of hours in it and I became pretty good at it. After a little break from playing games I got CS:GO and suddenly I couldn't let go of it... again.  What else is there to be said about me? I don't really know. I'm working a government office job and I am a soon to be student. I'd probably describe myself as friendly and passionate.  I think that's about it.	13-18 months	The community is growing really fast and I believe it get's a little bit hard to manage at times. That's why new mods are being "hired" probably.  With the exception of some obvious trolls I found the community to be very helpful. My Steam friendslist is filled with redditors and I'm frequently playing with them.
6/1/2015 6:51:18	http://www.reddit.com/user/slayeryo/	GMT+1	24	no	unfortunately no	its a great idea and i've been running such events for my friends back in the 1.6 days	i highly appreciate it and think it helps to improve not only low level players but also its a way to exchange strats/stuff for high level players.	My name is Marvin Slayer yo A. im 24 and from Germany, Regensburg. Currently working as a scientist in cancer research and applying to study medicin next year (hopefully).  I play counterstrike since 1.3. at a very high level on css since the early beginning and switched to league of legends after a while. i played league for a total of 3 years i think. mostly casual but still on a realtive high level (diamond).  eventhough i bought cs go at beta release i never got into it until the beginning of operation breakout i think. went to MGE after placements and 4games later i was at DMG (huh the pain). set my personal goal to be LEM by the end of this year. hit LEM close before the huge VAC waves and then proceeded to get global with my 160th win i think.  now i am looking to form a semi professional team to play some cups and ladders mostly on faceit.  well i don't know what to say im a bit nerdy but only to a certain degree ;) and i am very dissapointed that i haven't gotten a gift in this years e-sports exchange (Yes mr stranger i severely hate you for it) hopefully ill get a rematch to make up for it :)  in terms of reddit: i am mostly on the csgo subreddit and browsing /all from time to time. trying to help players most of the time and/or have a nice conversation about meta/tactics etc.  if you have any questions feel free to add me on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/slayeryo  ps it would be nice if you could share some experiences about your time as a mod and how much time you put into it.	10-12 months	mostly a great community.  regardless i still think a little less random topics and more gameplay / meta threads would be nice.  as a former league player i miss the topics about theorycrafting e.g.
6/1/2015 6:52:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/JustDaniel96/	GMT+2	19	WEB client side: Html/html5 Javascript CSS  WEB server side: PHP Java Servlet  DataBase: MySQL  Others: Java C C++		Sometimes i play the comminity nights, I love that event, a lot of kind and funny people when playing.	It's useful even if i don't partecipate a lot in this.	19 Years Old from italy, started playing cs go after watching the esl one cologne 2014. Discovered the subreddit a few days after i started playing.  I'm studing in an IT school and in 3 weeks I have my final exams and they are not related to CS GO :(	7-9 months	I like the community, it's getting bigger and bigger every day. One of the biggest problem is the "hate" that someone have against the poor silvers.  
6/1/2015 6:56:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/Krazyfire/	GMT+1	24	I am Electronic And Computing Graduate at University i learned PHP, HTML,CSS,Javascript,C+,Java and Phython	Yes i have my own small community of gamers we have our own server its ip is 176.57.129.81:27025 the community is http://worldmafia.net.	I think its a good experience playing with other players on reddit that have the same interests as you. Also the play testing maps is great fun and could help map creators with bugs and community feedback on what they can do to fix.	It's educational as i remember when it was on a Tuesday when i first joined the community it helped me learning the nitty gritty of the game.	I started gaming from a very young age i think 9 from CS 1.6 to SWAT 4 to Call of Duty 4 to League of Legends then Back to where is all started CS <3. From also Graduating this year from university i have worked in a computer repairs shop for 5 years i think i have gained quiet a lot of in-depth knowledge in computer repair where i could help the community if i see them needing help also i have ran my own community for a few years and now I'm looking for a new challenge something bigger as this sub reddit. I think i can be a good candidate in the Europe Time Zone. As being a computer nerd I'm practically always online from when i wake early to when i sleep late :D. I think I'm very Kind and soft hearted guy who is fair to everybody. I think i can bring same current fair moderating process that is currently being laid out. Please give me a chance <3 i won't let you guys down 	13-18 months	I think its well run so far i think we can have more days like newbie Thursday but for something else such as Friendly Friday or something where people in reddit could help each other out in game by adding them as friends?. The current modding process is well thought out and the rules laid out are fair 
6/1/2015 6:59:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/Marcolol	GMT+2	24	I have some knowledge of PHP / HTML / CSS and I have been Github a bit.  I worked for a french startup as a freelancer a while back : http://www.bitwiin.com/  I have NOT realized the whole website but I have worked on bits. It is only available in French though, sorry about that :)	I have no experience in admining CS:GO servers to be perfectly honest. A while back I played a lot of DoD Source and I did admin a server we bought with a team. It was only used for basic stuff : competitive games with other team, training some strats and just playing together.   It was not "community-oriented" but rather dedicated to a private use.	I have had the chance to participate in 3 or 4 Community Nights.  I find them great as I feel it is a part of this subreddit which is quite interesting. I love the fact that we can be a community not only on reddit but also in game.  Something that could maybe be interesting is to try out to "split" the types of players that take part in Community Nights. I feel like some people are there just to have fun and do some foolish stuff while others are there to play seriously or learn from higher ranks. The two are obviously fine but do not always co-exist very well. Maybe that could be incorporated in the "matchmaking" part of Community Nights ?	Absolutely love them. I like the fact that I can give back a bit of what I have learned from being adopted on the "Adopt a Silver" thread back in December.  And I still learn a lot by reading all the answers and different point of views.	Hello Mod Team !  I am /u/Marcolol but you can call me Marco. I am a 24 years old French gamer. I played CS when I was first 10 years old, but only on and off with friends, very casually.  I discovered Global Offensive and its subreddit during DreamHack Winter 2014 after two posts reached the front page : one about KQLY and another about olofmeister-boostmeister against my dear LDLC frenchmen :)   At that time I re-discovered Counter Strike and the strategical aspect that had eluded me all these years ! I fell in love with the scene and I got lucky by quickly making a lot of friends to play the game with after I replied to the "Adopt a Silver" thread. I went from Silver to LE in about 3 months, I learn a lot about the game and I had a ton of fun.  I love every bit of this game and the community that animates it. Streamers, commentators, reddit, betting etc... Those aspects are not always perfect and can also bring some negativity to the game (thinking about Betting for example) but I love how people are committed to this game we all love.  I have been a part of this subreddit and a player of this game for only a "short" time but I really want to give back to the community and be a catalyst to share what I had the fun and pleasure to discover these past months.  As to why I would be a good candidate to be added to the mod team : I think I am a very dedicated individual and I really want to be an active part for this community. I do not have a big experience in moderating, but I really want to start entering this scene (I am actually considering working in Esports) and I believe this subreddit is a good way to do so. I am a fast learner and a good listener, that is what they tell me at my job at least :). I would be happy to give it my all, I have a decent amount of free time during the week and on weekends, and I am pretty much always online (even at work). I currently live in Paris which puts me in the GMT+2 zone, and if I'm not mistaken you are still lacking a French mod. How can you live without baguette, I will never understand :)  Anyway I think that is it for me. I hope I gave you enough information about myself. If not, please fell free to AMA !  I am looking forward to your feedback and I really hope you will give me an opportunity to give back a bit of what this community has offered to me.  Marco	4-6 months	To be honest I am not sure I have been a member of this community long enough to be able to witness huge changes in the trend.  From what I see and comparing to other subreddits, here is what jumps to mind : - Good communication from mods to users and users to mods that allows to shape the sub (e.g. banner contest for example)  - I feel like the "split" of content submitted is good. Or at least that is fits what the users are expecting. I kind have a feeling that everyone always wants more "Discussion" but at the same time it is not being posted as much by those same users. - Following up on a previous point, maybe there could be an additional scheduled thread promoting discussions in some sort going over various  strategical aspects of the game (maps, weapons, history of a specific team etc...)  
6/1/2015 7:05:20	http://www.reddit.com/user/jq8678/	GMT+10	14		I have previously managed two CS:GO servers as well as moderated/administrated other Garry's Mod server which I won't go into.  One of the servers was a CS:GO Surf server where I and another co-manager would maintain the server. It had multiple plugins and add-ons including deathmatch, a weapon selector add-on etc.  Another was a CS:GO 1v1 server which wasn't around for as long, but worked. I had installed the 1v1 add-on, sourcemod and metamod along with one or two plug-ins for an excellent gameplay experience.  These server were both hosted on a dedicated server by poseidonservers.net which is a popular Australian community.	I haven't tried Community Night mainly because of the time zone and constraints but I of course would like to.	I have participated in Newbie Thursday once, asking a question about my consistency in CS:GO. This is where I received vital responses, key to my gameplay.	I am currently studying in Grade/Year 9. I like to consider myself addicted to CS:GO, boasting over 1000 hours, however still a newbie at Gold Nova 2 myself. There is not much to say other than a closing statement that I am free and available for many hours everyday and would enjoy being part of the team as a fair and just member.  Thanks. :)	4-6 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is an excellent one despite being decided as one of the most negative subreddits. Of course, the community has its individual strains, however the subreddit is moving in a positive direction overall.
6/1/2015 7:10:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/OrangeSnake	GMT+10	15	I have basic knowledge in html and CSS and know a bit of RBLX Lua (modified Lua).	Absolutely, this is actually one of my main hobbies I like to do apart from playing video games. I've had the opportunity to administrate games ranging from Minecraft to Just Cause 2 MP.  I also have the ability in administrating linux & windows dedis and VPSes which I mainly used for testing purposes and game servers. I'm still learning the ropes of source game servers though, but don't worry, I'll soon be a master in them :)	I think Community Night is a great way for the /r/globaloffensive community to get together and know each other better.  Personally, I don't have any other thoughts about this feature as it is quite new to me.	I believe that Newbie Thursday is a great implementation to the /r/globaloffensive subreddit and allows lower ranked players to get their questions answered from more experienced players. Other people also benefit from this as they can learn something new that they did not know about before.	My hobbits mainly consist of gaming, going on social media news sites (aka reddit) and trying out new things. I'm a person whom can be dead serious at times when needed or plain funny. I like to meet new people and  make new friends. I'm an easy type of going guy and I can be a great team player. As a /r/globaloffensive moderator, I will take my voluntary job seriously while having fun at the same time. The reason being why I am applying today is so that I can help out the community and not because I want extra "virtual powers" or higher authority. I wish the best of luck to all the hundreds of applications applying alongside me and the best of the future to the subreddit.	4-6 months	I'm going to be honest here, the current /r/GlobalOffensive community is actually very helpful and creative. Even though sometimes there appears to be many "shitposts" being upvoted, it often clears up after a major event or update. This subreddit is one that I visit nearly every single day (mostly lurk though :x) alongside many other known subreddits.There isn't anything really needed be improved along the community, it is great how it is and I love that :)
6/1/2015 7:12:54	http://reddit.com/u/Eckolog	GMT+2	17	HTML, CSS, C#	I have some experience with CS:GO server, moderating my own server for PUGS etc. I had to install the server on linux, setup the configs and start the server 	It's nice imo. altho I didn't join any :P	I love it. I love answering the questions also if I have questions I just ask them. Its really good that we (reddit users) have a thread like that where we can just ask any question we'd like.	Well I'm 17 years old currently living in Slovenia. I'm playing CS:GO my current matchmaking rank is Legendary Eagle Master. I have ~1000hrs of CS:GO atm. I'm playing for Exsequor Gaming team as IGL. I'm a very calm guy not aggressive at all I'm just chilled out in any situation. I also played cod4 in one of the highest levels. I have a lot of experience with competitive scene, been to lan in my own country aswell. Why would it be good if I was a mod? Well I like to help people and I'm active on reddit from 7AM GMT+2 to like 3PM GMT+2, then like 2 hours at home aswell.	0-3 months	To be honest some people are really nice but on the other hand some people are just disrespectful, not thankful for anything, trolling, etc..
6/1/2015 7:23:51	http://www.reddit.com/user/BondieZXP/	GMT+0	17	Experience in Java,Python and HTML. Also doddled in VB.	No experience in admining CS:GO servers. However have vast knowledge in minecraft and runescape servers, including running multiple.	I like the concept. Getting the community involved with eachother so people can gain knowledge and make friends.		Been involved in the computer and technology scene for years now.  I first got interested within gaming playing runescape. Played it for years and realised the massively popular runescape private servers which I took a real interest in. I founded my own private server, called "Swiftisium", and built it up within a few months to over 150 players online at a time (which was a real achievement, due to the popularity of the servers). This is where i first found my love for programming, and learnt a lot within those months, however since I haven't worked on a big project. A year later or so I took the server down due to lack of time to keep up with updates and run the server, and moved onto youtube.  I created a youtube channel called "BondieeeeXBL", where I uploaded call of duty videos, and with the release of Black Ops 2, the channel gained almost 30,000 subscribers, and continues to grow to this day, however I recently stopped uploading. Mainly due to the fact that Call of Duty grew tiresome, and Counter Strike has taken over my life and social life.  And here I am today. Looking to go into an application development job next year when I finish school, or continue on in education to university, learning a bit extra in development and design, digital media.	4-6 months	I love the reddit as a whole, spending hours a day browsing and laughing at some of the videos and montages that get created and posted. However there are still the egotistical people who feel the need to constantly criticize users, and prove them wrong which 99% of the time is completely unneeded. 
6/1/2015 7:34:36	http://www.reddit.com/user/kedde1x/	GMT+2	20	Yes. Before starting on university, I coded numerous websites for various companies. Additionally, I am currently working on two projects. These two can be seen here (note: Both websites are in danish):  * http://beta.whattodo.dk/ - An online portal in which, you can search for events, restaurants, etc. based on city, number of participants and max. price pr. participant.  * http://voresopgang.dk/ - An online tool, which connects citizens in the same housing unions. This can also be to connect people on the same road.  Other than the above, I study Software Engineering on Aalborg University in Aalborg, Denmark. I am currently on 2. semester. So far I have passed 2 courses; General Programming, and Imperative Programming. Other than that, I am currently taking another course, called Object Oriented Programming, in which I have exam this thursday. All my projects on university involves programming, and on 4. semester I will even make my own language and compiler.	About three years ago, I was the main admin on a Minecraft server with over a thousand active users (which was a lot at the time). It was the community server of the Machinima Makers Bashcraft (https://www.youtube.com/user/Bashurverse). It was hosted, so that I could log onto Windows Remote Access, and then edit files, run the server, etc.	I love the Community Night. I just recently (about 5 weeks ago) started participating, because my friend (TaF) showed it to me. Ever since then, I have been an active player each week, and I have to say that they are my most enjoyable hours each week, which says a lot. My name on there is Chraebe, if you recognize me.	I haven't participated in Newbie Thursday, but I really like the concept. It is great to see people engage themselves into helping new or less talented players to improve their game. I would like to help new players, but I feel that people in higher ranks are better able to help them (I'm currently DMG).	My name is Christian Aebeloe, I am 20 years old from Aarhus, Denmark. I currently live with my girlfriend in Aalborg, Denmark, where I also study Software Engineering on Aalborg University. I had a hard time in my childhood, where I was bullied a lot, and a father who was an alcoholic. All this made me espace in to the world of video gaming, which I have stayed in, even though my life has gotten easier. A little over two years ago (January 2013) my father died when I was at the age of 18. Ever since then, I have made myself care more about the things I enjoy in life, which includes Counter Strike and /r/GlobalOffensive.  I see myself as a mature, patient, helpful guy. I try my best to make sure everyone are happy, even if it means I am unhappy. I'd like to think I am pretty fluent in english, even though it is only my third language (Danish and German nr. 1 and 2). I am online on Reddit most of the day (even during University work), while I am online on CS:GO typically after 4pm, GMT+2.	10-12 months	Well, I like the community, which is why I spend so much time on it. Though, I feel like it is easy to see the growth of the game in how the Reddit community behaves. This is not neccesarily a bad thing, as it is bound to happen when a game grows as much as CS:GO has done lately. And after all, I do want the game to grow even more.
6/1/2015 7:44:20	http://reddit.com/u/JustFredrik	GMT+1	16	I have used HTML and CSS and made some websites, for myself. and I regularly use GameMaker Studios language to program games.	I've been Moderator and admin on a few smaller minecraft servers, some years ago.	It's a nice thing to get the people of CSGO together	Good for begginers to get help and inprove their skill.	I'm intrested in game-design and gaming in general I love nature and I regularly take trips in the wild. both my mother and father is from northern sweden so nature is very inportant to me.  I've been playing CS GO for 2 years and my current MM rank is Legendary Eagle master.  I'm a skilled graphic designer for my age.  I use Source SDK regularly and love to make maps. I've made a few skins.  I think the reddit part of the CS community is really grate and I would like to be a part of the front line of r/globaloffensives bright side.  I want to maintain a nice environment and to make it a nice place where people can have civil arguments without the trolls of internet inerupting.  I would say that i tend to not personally get involved in arguments and just look at it from a logic side. I allways try to go for the logic solution and not the emotional one.  I play Piano, Flute and Guitar. Me and my friends like to just play music and have fun when we hangout.  Hope to hear from you  //Fredrik	4-6 months	It's current state is focused alot on gameplay and funny things around the game. I think that the comunity would benefit if we had a contentShare Saturday where members can share their skins, maps and other creations such as wallpapers pictures videos and other things conected to the game.
6/1/2015 7:51:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/Dolanqt/	GMT+2	19	HTML, PHP	CSS Server owner and admin in 2011-2013	I love it.	Very nice idea. I love it.	I'm a 19 year old student from Finland who loves CS and the scene :-3  I like helping people and also play League of Legends. Very active on PC.	10-12 months	Sometimes I hate the community but usually its okay.
6/1/2015 8:00:59	http://reddit.com/u/adriun	UTC+1	16	I know some basic HTML, not more than that. Although i learn fast and could try to get on some basic coding if that would be necessary.	Yes, I have worked at Games4u, an Swedish community that gives out free server hosting. I know the software good and am familiar with configs, commands and such. These were just regular game-servers alá 5on5.	I haven participated in one yet, although i think its an really good concept. Would love to help and develop it further!	I think its an good idé, people often get fast responses so I myself don't really find the opportunity to help people out, but of course, I really love that people can freely ask questions around the game that we all love.	So, this is my favorite part..  My name is Adrian "pigglejn" Lexell and I'm 16 years old. I started playing CS:GO in august 2013. In December of 2013 i joined the Swedish facebook group "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (Sverige)" as an administrator. This group is much like the GO-subreddit, its community-based and we are just here to administrate.   In February 2014 i joined FaceIT as support and as server administrator. I learned eBot and CS:GO-servers in general. I left FaceIT in April 2014 due to them being really un-organized and refused to listen to critic.   Some time went by and I put most on my focus at the facebook-group and improve my own gameplay. I hosted some tournaments and assisted Mod645 with the Fragbite Masters Qualifiers for Season 3.  In October 2014 i joined Games4u as an administrator. I hosted some daily tournaments until January 2015 where i (officially) left to focus on the facebook-group, witch now had expanded into an Swedish Non-profit organization.   Since then i have hosted an series of tournamets called Lemondogs CSGOSWE Tour #X with an total price pool of around 2500€. I also have some work around GBG Games (Gothenburg's response to GameX).   Under the years i have done the following, in an simple track record: - CSGOSWE Administrator. - FaceIT support and server management. - CSGOSWE Tour #2 (an simple tournament with 128 teams). - CSGOSWE Tour #3 (same as above) - Fragbite Masters S3 Qualifiers as an admin. - Games4u Tournament administrator.  I have also visited events as: - Dreamhack Summer 2013 - Dreamhack Winter 2013 - Copenhagen Games 2014 - Dreamhack Summer 2014 (Media) - Dreamhack Stockholm 2014 (Media) - Dreamhack Winter 2014 (Media) - Inferno Online Pantamera Challenge CS:GO (Media) - Copenhagen Games 2015 (Media) - Birdie 2015 (Media)  Just ask if theres something you wounder about! Thanks in advance, - Adrian.  E-mail: CSGOSWEAdrian@hotmail.com CSGOSWE: https://csgoswe.se CSGOSWE-group: http://facebook.com/groups/csgosweden Steam profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/pigglejn	13-18 months	I think theres a bit to much fluff, but reddit is community-based in the fact that its the users themselves that chose whats being viewed. I think there could be some work done, but overall its an great place to hang out.
6/1/2015 8:01:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/LiLaLeXx99/	UTC+0	16	No experience in coding, but I'm looking into starting this summer when I have lots of free time	No hosting with regards to CS:GO yet, but I am organizing a CS:GO tournament in the summer (http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/37v06t/for_anyone_interested_in_a_free_to_enter_csgo/) and have been admin on many Minecraft servers (obviously before I joined the CS:GO masterrace XD) I am also looking to help organise the Reddit cup, because it's such a great idea but I have seen so many people complaining about small problems which I could help fix.	I haven't participated in community night as of yet, but in the summer I know I will. I just prefer playing competitive at the moment, because I only have limited time gaming in between revision, so I spend that time playing 5-mans. However, in the summer I'm looking to expand my horizons and try some of the more community based gamemodes, and the Community Night looks perfect for that :D	The Newbie Thursday is, in my opinion, the best part of /r/GlobalOffensive. At first I felt a bit patronized when I found myself looking for answers on a thread with that name, but then I grew up and understood the humour. I have learned so much from this thread, however I propose it be renamed to something like Silver Thursday, because I think some people feel deterred by being a "Newbie". Just my opinion, though.	I'm 16, in year 11 in an English grammar school, so I'm doing GCSE's at the minute (I should probably revise in a minute). The upside to the whole GCSE's thing is that I have 2 and a half months off this summer to play CS:GO and browse Reddit. I am around gold nova 4 in CS:GO using my laptop and trusty mouse (http://www.motor-mouse.net/shop/computermice/the-classic-sportscar/) <-lol and plan to get a PC in the summer. I am part of a CS:GO team (Aspire E-Sports) along with my 4 teammates and we are entering lots of tournaments thanks to /r/GlobalOffensive. I like things other thank CS; football, tennis, table tennis, and I play the guitar and the piano. In my opinion I am a generally outgoing person, and although I haven't contributed as much as I could to this community, I feel as though I definitely will this summer. I live in a rural area and was pretty isolated in my childhood when I come to think of it, so I only started gaming with my good ol' PS2 when I was about 11. CS:GO seems like the game for me, and this  subreddit is my go-to place if I have any problems or if I am not revising.	4-6 months	When I first came across /r/GlobalOffensive it seemed more of a news center for the CS:GO community. However, now there are also the tips and tricks type posts and community kills/clutches etc. I feel the community has become more outgoing and that is why I am applying for this position!
6/1/2015 8:07:55	https://www.reddit.com/user/AmaKi_	UTC+1	18	No, except the HTML that steam show to help	Yes, I am a member and moderator/admin on the WantedGoV Community servers: DM,AWP,Trade and TS.	I dont follow it	I dont follow it	Im a 18 years old student from Italy, that likes tech,games(csgo,dota,rust,hearthstone),surf the net and other thing like football(soccer),gym and hang out with friends. Thats all Ciaoooo :)	10-12 months	I think its cool you can always find new things like news,bugs,info and a lot of nice and funny stuff
6/1/2015 8:13:02	https://www.reddit.com/user/BlitzWithGuns/	UTC+8	16	No. 	Yes. I was a admin once in a small server called mcpeunited.icyboards.net. The server was active from late 2014-early 2015 until it suffered an issue of inactive members. It was hosted by a server hosting service called Icyboards. The forum was based on the Pocket Edition of Minecraft. 	I haven't been on Community Night before, unfortunately. Therefore, I can't say much about it.	It looks to be a pretty good area for new CS GO players to come to and get help and answers from better players! I myself might require some help from these better gamers, since I have trouble myself learning how to aim for the head and successfully get a kill (I regularly aim for the head, somehow my shots seem to circle around the enemies head. How is this even possible?)	Well, I'm Matt from Malaysia, which is a country above Singapore (That country seems to be much more known than my country! XD). I'm 16, and I took up serious CS gaming at the start of this year. I'm at GN 3 now, but I don't deserve my rank at all since I never seem to be at the level of those higher ranked dudes! Thank my carrying friends and my sheer luck at finding decent games.  I didn't expect CS to take up so much of my life now, as I play almost 3 hours of it everyday, bringing my play time up to 250 hours at the time of writing. Guess it's those typical teen habits where they stop reading books and move over to computer gaming to satisfy themselves.   I would want to become a moderator on the forum so that I can prevent trollers and toxic people from affecting the community, as mentioned above. Since I'm basically online everyday, I should be able to provide a decent service to Reddit, once I get the hang of it! Hanging around Reddit will improve my skills, since I get to learn more tips from the pros through the forum posts. Who knows, I might actually enter MG Elite one day! Dreams happen...   Anyways, thanks for reading my application form! I hope that you will consider my application and have a good day, my man! :D   	0-3 months	The community is mature, compared to other forums that I've been too. It definitely is the opposite of the COD community, which I've heard is full of toxic players and people that think that they are the best at their game. Of course, there are some trollers around the forums. That is where moderators come in. To help create a better environment on the online community and removing those who attempt to waver the condition of the area. (Just like cheaters. Honestly, who likes them? Unless you happen to have one on your team! ;) Well, that would suck too for the enemy team.)   I've only came to the forum recently, during the past few months. Therefore, I couldn't see much of it and how people used to react and communicate in the past. But all I can say now is that things seem to be going smoothly and good posts have good replies under them! The community is definitely posting some good stuff around here, like bots that somehow kill them in a single headshot, though they shot the bots in the head for at least 5 times, and discussions that talk about how OP one weapon is and what can be done. Valve probably won't listen to the community though. (Look at the AWP now. Slowing down the zoomed-in speed won't help a thing).   In short, the community is awesome. :D

Very helpfull threads for beginners and unexperienced players.	I'm a 17 year old guy living in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm currently visiting a IT School in Zurich, so i'm somewhat experienced with computers. CS is by far my favourite game and i love browsing the GO subreddit. 	7-9 months	All in all, I like the community. Most of the people are nice, and if someones inappropriately rude, it gets taken care of. I love surfing the subreddit if I'm to tired to play games or bored at school ;).
6/1/2015 8:55:40	http://www.reddit.com/user/ZeroFreez/	UTC+3	15	Not at all,but i plan on starting courses about coding this autumn <]	I was an admin on a national server (I'm from Romania btw).I was there for 2 months and a half or so,but the people around there weren't so kind and most of the time it felt like only me and another guy were actually moderating so i left.I just did simple stuff like ban ppl or help new guys on the server,change maps,do polls and that's all.	Never participated,but good initiative by the mods.IMO,it's nice because we all have a chance to meet great ppl while testing some community maps ;)	Good way on helping new persons. I always support this kind of threads.	I'm from Romania and sometimes people think I'm russian because of my accent (our language is close to theirs and i have a somehow deep voice too xD).

I like cats and cache. ☚(ﾟヮﾟ☚)    I talk...a lot	0-3 months	Been here for 2-3 months i could actually see it growing quite some in this little time. It actually feels like more lol players are coming here (been on that sub way before i created a reddit account).More more suggestions of "do this and that",but that's none of my business when it comes to the community. I think anyone has at least 1 suggestion for this sub or the game in general so...
6/1/2015 9:03:24	http://reddit.com/user/AJSAMartin	GMT+1	19	I know the basics of JavaScript, and HTML, But, besides that I have no experience in coding.	I used to admin/host a couple of CS 1.6 servers(Diablomod, GunGame) but I never had a chance to admin a CSGO server. 	I think that's a good idea, most of the people don't have enough friends who would be willing to play on a map they had never played.   It also helps the map creators to see how they could improve the map which is great. 	I have not been paying attention to Newbie Thursday, I might have opened a thread once but other than that, I was not interested in it. Not that it's a bad idea, I just had no interest in it.	OK...  My name is Marcin, I was born in Poland but recently moved to the UK after my whole family convinced me to move out of the country with them.  I currently study QA(Yes, you can actually study it;) Game Design, and Computer Programming. I'm also interested in making maps in Hammer, but that hasn't been woeking out for me.. My current situation doesn't allow me to move out to the public University, so I take courses Online. This has its advantages as well as a lot of disadvantages. Advantages being that I don't have to move out of the house to study, and I can stay up late, disatavantages being that I spend a lot of time inside...  I'm usually pretty lazy when it comes to things other than school, but when I'm asked to do something, I'll do it perfectly. I'm also a fan of learning new languages, but so far I can only speak Polish, English and intermediate Japanese. When I'll reach somewhat of a fluidity in Japanese, I'll move on to Swedish.  About CS, I've been playing since I was 10, but I never really got into watching pro games until last year when CSGO exploded.   Other than that, I don't have anything more interesting to say.	10-12 months	I think the community matured a little after the recent controversies, eg. VAC bans, ESEA. Other than that, I don't think it's changed that much. It's still the best platform to discuss CSGO.  There are still a bit of HLTV-ish troll comments but they get buried in down votes so people can't see them anyway.
6/1/2015 9:05:56	http://reddit.com/user/gravitr0n	GMT-5	28	A small amount, Basic HTML	No experience	I have not participated, typically because I like to stay fluent on official maps and competitive play.	100% great thing.

I am a 28-year-old graphic designer and I have contributed a lot of UGC to the global offensive subreddit (mostly wallpapers featuring pro teams). I have never been a mod, so maybe I am not the greatest choice. But I am a mature, intelligent person who can learn fast and who genuinely loves this game. 	10-12 months	I think the community is overall good. I think as time goes on and the sub sees an influx of new, younger players, people may need to be reminded of respect and empathy and things like that. It seems some posts get downvoted on a bully-type level rather than for being false/inaccurate content.
6/1/2015 9:18:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/v1llel/	GMT+3	15	C++, C#, Javascript, Python, Autohotkey but im not really good in all, just basic stuff mostly.	Yeah, ive been a admin/host in CSS servers. They were bought from a hoster who doesnt host anymore and i cannot remember the name anymore. But yeah they were bought servers and ive also hosted freegamehosting servers for something like PCW's on css. And the servers i had on css/moderated/ were admin on, they had a really big community. The slots were 24 and it were on full everyday almost all the time :D	Well they seem cool but i havent been on them.	Newbie Thursday is very good for starters of cs :D	Well im not going to share my real name unless its needed but im a 15-year old from finland :P I love to visit reddit daily which i indeed do every morning and throughout the day i probably visit reddit a good 10 times a day :D I do speak pretty fluent english but i mostly just cba with all the ' etc. On my diploma ive got 10 on english, im really far ahead of my classmates on english. They can speak just barely half of my english skills. English is like a second language for me :P I cant think about anything right now to tell you anymore. Hope i'll be a mod and have a nice day :P	10-12 months	Well, Ive mostly been a "silent reader" so ive just been reading all the topics and posts etc, sometimes ive posted myself too :P 
6/1/2015 9:23:06	http://reddit.com/u/hardhardlemonhard	GMT+0	18	Honestly not but I am interested in learning HTML basics soon.	I admined a 1.6 13 slot server a long time ago for mixes between friends. I am very rusty now, I was under 10 at the time.	Community nights are great and the people that participate are very mature. I personally cannot stay after 11pm because I have to get up very early, but would like to participate a lot more often.	I think those threads are too repetitive and should be reduced to twice/thrice a month. Most questions are answered on other threads or people just create them anyway.	I have been visiting this subreddit since 2013 but I have never been too active due to my poor English skills back then. I created an account when I was more comfortable with this lovely language.  I used to moderate a guild's forum on tribal wars. The guild consisted of 100 members and the forum was shared with three other guilds, so around 400 members total. The forums were very, very active, but I had a lot of time back then when I was 14.    I am constantly on reddit through my smartphone but I can have access to a computer whenever I want, although these mobile bricks are much more practical don't you think?   I want to be a moderator on this subreddit because I love this game and I love this community, for the good or for the bad. I know how hard it is to moderate a forum, even if I only have experience with a forum of 400 people. I want to help this community grow by helping new people knowing this game a little better.  I think that taking the responsibility of moderating such a big subreddit is also a great chance for personal improvement.	7-9 months	What I noticed is that there has been an increasing number of pointless threads each month and the relevant content is having trouble reaching the front page recently. Plus comments that show a valid point, although not very popular, are being down voted immediately giving space to jokes and comments that go with the general public opinion at the moment.
6/1/2015 9:28:04	http://www.reddit.com/user/WireItUp/	UTC+10	16	Not at all, really. I've had some experience with VB, if that counts for anything.	Yep. I was an admin on a community called 'High Standard Gaming' (HSG), which was centred around Garry's Mod (TTT - Trouble in Terrorist Town), and this server was quite popular in the time it was open. The community also played games such as CSGO, Minecraft, DayZ and other games.	Cant really comment much. I've had a skim through community night posts, but have never been able to make it onto the servers due to time difference.	I have seen the Newbie Thursday post, although, I'm yet to begin frequently reading it.	I'm from Australia, I've been playing CSGO for a year and a half now, and it's also my first counter-strike. I enjoy gaming with mates whenever I can, and CSGO is what we play most. I love sports, as I play and watch aussie rules football. Music wise, I love oldies (queen, adrenalin, twisted sister, and a fair few others).  Thanks for reading.	4-6 months	From the short time I've been here, it's great. I enjoy reading and/or watching community made posts, and making contributions where I can, via the comments section. Of course, you'll have the occasional troll post, but current moderators take care of those quite swiftly. 
6/1/2015 9:52:01	https://www.reddit.com/user/metaldragon199/	UTC+2	23	C/C++.java,php  somewhat regex html,and js  basically am i software development engineer so i should be fine with pretty much anything 				i hate writing about myself but eh here goes nothing  i've been gaming since i was 5   recently started working and i spend between 10%(when i have work) to 90% (when the clients are being ****s and not replying ) of my work time on reddit   i like metal  and please don't judge my english by this i really hate talking about myself	0-3 months	
6/1/2015 9:53:50	http://www.reddit.com/user/idonthavecrabs/	UTC-6	17	ive coded my own website in Html/css. learned java and some basic PHP. Willing to learn whatever else is needed.	Never modded in any servers, modded in some subreddits before but they were nsfw,small and prob not worth mentioning.	I think its a fun way for the cs community to get together and just hang out.	I Think its great for explaining the game and game mechanics. its good because it provides a q/a place for people and it allows them to ask questions with out being hated on. Which allows these people to get better. Hopefully I can be of more use to the people who ask questions.	Outside of my computer I go to high school, I work at a chickfila, so i've developed somewhat of a skill for solving/defusing problems and dealing with enraged people. I used to teach at a snowboard school. When i'm at home I usually am playing some counter strike or browsing reddit. Sometimes I stream but stopped to concentrate on school, but now that the  years over I can hopefully start that back up again. Just a computer nerd looking to help out a community I plan to stay apart of.	10-12 months	I honestly think its starting to go downhill, seems that overall people are focusing more on skins/cheaters and all the problems rather than the game itself. It would be my preference that overall /r/GlobalOffensive could be a positive place and not so much of a place to complain. While its all good that cheaters and being brought to light, it seems that they just getting a short lived fame out of it. I do support pretty much everything else on here.  
6/1/2015 9:55:53	http://reddit.com/u/homeless_WOLF	UTC+10	14	HTML, CSS, some Python, little Ruby			Might be too repetitive	I'm from Sydney and don't really do much apart from hang out on IRC or play games. 	10-12 months	Fairly well-conducted, with a high level of shitposting. New readers really need to acclimate themselves with the game before flooding the subreddit with posts though.
6/1/2015 10:16:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/cas_tee/	GMT+3	14	No	No	It's a really good place to meet other ridditors test maps and just have fun with people that have the same interests and the same hobby to play CS.	Great idea to help new players and CS veterans to learn how to play CS:GO and how much fun it is!	Well i'm a 14 y/o kid from Lithuania.I go to a music school and also i like games like i REALLY love games.I follow the CS competitive scene and dream to become a professional CS player.	10-12 months	on a personal level /r/GlobalOffensive is my home. Couldn't live without it a single day.And i really enjoy quality shitposts.
6/1/2015 10:17:39	http://reddit.com/u/panda885	GMT-4	24	I know a bit of HTML and PHP. Made my own WoW private server back in the day and had a website with c/p to accommodate accordingly.	I do not have any experience with CSGO admin, however I used to have my own server back in 1.6.   1 for scrims, 1 with warcraft mod, and 1 with superhero mod.	Community nights are a good way to get the subreddit involved, although I have not participated often I still think it's a great idea.	Newbie Thursdays are good, however it seems a lot of the same questions get asked over and over again.	I'm currently employed as a Business Development Director at an energy company. I have a bachelors in Environmental engineering and environmental science.   I've played CS since 1.3 going to Internet cafes because I only had dial up... Once I got cable internet at home is when I played CS non stop. I took a break once CSS came out and now I'm back in CSGO.  Thanks for taking the time to review, let me know if you have any questions.	19-24 months	I believe the community is good, of course there is a lot of complaining and a sense of entitlement but it would be nice for people to take a realistic stand point as opposed to telling Valve to do this and that without knowing the whole picture.
6/1/2015 10:22:36	https://reddit.com/u/bigbluepanda	GMT+10	15	C++, C#, dabbled in python and HTML though not properly learnt	I think it'd be better if you clarified this through PM - do you mean admin as in server admin (uploading/updating stuff etc.) or user admin (enforcing the rules in the server etc.)?   In terms of server admin - I've helped several people work with their gmod servers back in the day though have never personally had one. Most were hosted on Hypanova (a TTT host for the most part), and, like most gmod servers, had the usual - custom outfits, weapons, rules, motd, etc.	It'd be awesome if you could pull it off although from experience it's also fairly hard in scheduling. Also it would require some formal research/planning beforehand so it doesn't fall apart. I haven't participated in any reddit gaming community nights as they generally don't have convenient times for me (even in Australian time zone) so I can't speak from experience to how well they're managed, though.	Love it. Used to go through it every week, trying to pick up new tips to help out. I don't go through it in so much detail anymore now that I have less time to play the game (and of course, my skill having improved) but whenever I can I pop in on the off chance that there's something I haven't learnt yet.	Where to start?  I'm a student. I enjoy gaming, talking to people, studying (true), reading, browsing the internet, learning history, maths, physics, and biology. I wish I was more talented so I could actually do something but right now I kind of just float along. It's not too bad.  If I could sum up my life in one line I wish it'd be something like feeling like a plastic bag drifting through the wind but that wouldn't be exactly accurate. I'd describe it more as though, if you were in a ballroom dance, you'd be the one trying your best not to look terrible at dancing and barely missing all the other couples (which reminds me - I would recommend a reading of Athol Fugard's 'Master Harold and the Boys' which uses this same analogy).  There's not much more else to say..? 	13-18 months	Active although lurking (similar to most people). I guess there's really not much to /add/ on other than the obvious continual repetition of fixes Valve needs to implement, issues with the scene, etc. etc. threads that always come around eventually.  Something that I found though was that I noticed recently there have been a lot more 'fun' posts (what the top comments of these threads would normally label as 'shitposts') - e.g. the one where the terrorists wear sunglasses because they don't want de dust 2 get in their eyes - I love these posts and of the other subs I visit, I can off the top of my head be reminded by /r/skyrim and /r/dota2 where these commonly appear.   Over time, the community has, similar to really all the other multiplayer-type gaming communities, changed to become a constantly morphing /thing/. There's nothing specific I can really say about the community other than more notably 'louder' people, and the downvote = disagree mentality that tends to be noticeable in large subreddits. There also tends to be a more 'us v. them' kind of situation where an ambiguous comment that goes against the grain is more often than not heavily criticised or otherwise trodden into the ground.
6/1/2015 10:35:48	https://reddit.com/u/SpaceMagnet	GMT-4	15	Yes, I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS, but not enough to make anything look nice, as well as some experience in making python programs.	I do not have experience in moderating servers of any kind.	I think it is a great idea however I have never been able to participate in it. I love the idea of playing CSGO with other nice and non toxic players, as it creates an all around good experience.	It really helps out new players, which as someone who used and still uses discussions like these to find out how to improve I think they are vital for helping out players of any level and sharing information	I am a current high school student with a interest in electronics, computer science, and gaming. I am mostly a lurker on reddit, however I do see many posts, especially on /r/GlobalOffensive. I have been playing CS:GO actively for about eight or nine months, getting from silver two to gold nova three due in no small part to this sub, which exposed me to many things I as a player am doing wrong, showed me the correct way to do things, and motivated me to try to get better. As for moderating I enjoy giving my time to help out wherever I can, and I want to be able to help the community in any way I can, because I enjoy being a part of the community and want to make it better, as well as making sure other people can enjoy it too.	7-9 months	
6/1/2015 10:37:58	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealSlow/	GMT+1	17	Yeah, I've done several websites. Some was built from the bottom and some in Wordpress. Besides that I have hacking experience, where I've been a little naughty boy before. I've worked with HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Python. Object-C, and VB.net. Inside hacking, I've worked with SQL injection, POST-GET exploits, and XSS(Cross-site scripting) exploits.	Not in CS:GO. But I used to own the largest danish MG server in CSS around 3-4 years ago.	I don't have an opinion, since I've never been there.	I don't have an opinion, since I've never been there.	I dropped out of what's equal to college, and worked at McDonalds for around 4 months. Currently I am working as a journalist for a danish eSport organisation called Soul Gaming, and besides that I am trying to make a living off of streaming.  Sorry about my bad Reddit reputation. All the negative reputation comes from League of Legends, where I somehow fucked up, I don't even remember it. I made a joke about a friend, and I wrote a bad comment. Not sure why, and I don't even understand my own comment.	10-12 months	Full of trolls, and that's why the forum is even better. I love the smell of sarcasm in the morning.
6/1/2015 11:14:48	http://www.reddit.com/user/endnote/	GMT-4	31	Some basic Python and HTML. 	I used to run a server in 1.6 and CS:S in previous years. Currently I'm employed as a systems administrator as my full time job. 	Great way to bring people together to have fun and relax. My best years in counter-strike was in a similar environment. 	It's nice to have for a game that is growing rapidly. 	I'm a 31 year old married straightedge dude. My big passions are hardcore, gaming, and soccer. I started playing games when I was 5. My dad gave me a NES. I picked up PC Gaming around 1999.   I try to stay active and help foster good communities in both gaming and hardcore because they honestly saved my life. Punk and hardcore shows was the first place I felt welcome. If it weren't for hardcore, I wouldn't be where I am.   Hardcore bands, lyrics, and friends encouraged me to keep improving and pushing myself forward. Through hardcore I've made some of the closest friends and genuine people.   A friend I met through hardcore was the one who helped me get my first IT job and ended the retail hell I was stuck in.   Another friend I met through hardcore was the one who went to PAX East 2010 with me. Which led to me working the show each year since. This led to me making friends in Boston. Those friends gave me a couch to stay on so I could see a reunited hardcore band play a show (American Nightmare, December 29th 2011). During that stay I met the woman I would later marry. She helped bring me to Boston.   I very much value community and what it can do for a person and these experiences have ultimately had the greatest affect on my life.   My day to day routine is pretty normal. Work, commute home, walk the dog, and similar stuff. I keep busy with pick up soccer, a weekly podcast I create, and various other activities. 	2-3 years	Generally pretty good. I've watched it grow since the game was first released. It's definitely evolved from a small tight knit community to a massive thing which of course changes the face a bit. 
6/1/2015 11:13:46	http://reddit.com/u/AlexJenkinss	GMT+5	20	I have a solid understanding of Javascrip, took 2 courses on it in school. I have also messed around with HTML before but nothing specific there, just the basics.	I was a moderator on a CS:S forum/commuity named 420Mafia (now called Elevated Gamers Network). I also owned and managed 2 cs:go Intermediate level teams. In there, I administrated the teamspeak and practice server	Never really participated in it, seems like a solid idea though. 	Definitely something that I used myself to improve my knowledge of the game, so I'd say it's definitely helpful.	20 year old college student from NJ, currently studying International Studies with a minor in Psychology. Big aviation buff, as well as a video game fanatic since the age of 5. I have been playing CS games since 2007 (Started with Source). 	10-12 months	Besides the occasional circlejerking and witch hunts, the community is a solid place not only to learn something but also to find entertainment value among the community. 
6/1/2015 11:20:09	http://reddit.com/u/somebodystolemyname	GMT-6	22	HTML from way back when (mainly use dreamweaver now, but don't do much HTML anymore), Java, C, little bit of C++. Slowly learning PHP but CS keeps getting in the way ;) Currently a Comp-Sci Major in University.	Not with CS:GO but I used to manage/run a CSS community a couple of years ago, we had about 1k members. FDGaming is what it was called. I used to have 1.6 & CSS servers back in the day for IRC scrims/matches. I ran a CS:GO server on my VPS a couple months back, but stopped due to using it for a mail server.	I've personally never been able to make it to one, but I love the idea and I always support community involvement, because lets face it - we spend most of the time talking to each other anyways, might as well play together.	Great for people to learn and not get flamed. I have 2 little brothers who are into CS:GO now (gotta train em young ;) ) and I love the fact that I know if I'm not around, they can post on the thread to get answers to some questions. Knowledge is an amazing thing, and I feel like we need to promote as much of it as we can to the players who may not know the "typical" things about CS.	I'm from Canada - I only ride my polar bear to work on the really cold days - I have been playing CS since the beta days (my dad got it and I started playing it with him), I've always had a love for computers, and PC gaming since my dad & uncle are big into it.   Aside from CS, my favourite FPS game is the Ghost Recon Series (Desert Siege, Island Thunder) as I used to play with my dad, uncle, and their friends online and had such a blast. FPS are by far my favourite gametype, however I still love me some old school Warcraft 2 Battle.net edition every once in a while.  I'm currently a Comp-Sci Major in University. I want to create and develop things that people can interact with; things that make lives easier for the users (I was working on a Twitch audio only Android app since they didn't have it and I love listening to tournaments if I'm driving, but alas they updated it).  I love music. I can honestly say that I listen/have music playing almost 24 hours a day. I listen to it at work, while I'm driving, around the apartment, and even when I sleep. I'd like to say that I play guitar, but I wouldn't give myself thaaat much credit ;) I do however play the harmonica, and LOVE to jam to some good blues tracks.  I am getting married in a month to my best friend and beautiful fiancee (she's a console fan - mainly RPG's - and I'm trying to convert her to CS ;) )  Those are pretty well the big things about me, hopefully you guys like it and I get the chance to join the team ;)  Thanks for your time and for reading through all of this!  Cheers, Dillon C (somebodystolemyname)	13-18 months	I feel like the community as a whole has gotten worse over the time I've spent here, however I do see a solid userbase who really care about this game. I do love the rise in players, and interest in general towards CS:GO, but with that there comes the "hive" mentality. Don't get me wrong, I check the subreddit multiple times a day, try to filter out new posts (super repetitive ones that we see every day), and for the most part I love what I see. It's just I feel like the community gets up in arms very easily - first example being the flusha incident. I mean one or two posts are kind of comical, however 20+ posts of "flusha proof" is unnecessary, and filled the subreddit with the same type of information that you see on a newspaper front page when a scandal hits. Other than that I feel that there are a lot of members who contribute positively towards the community, and people are constantly finding bugs, nades, tutorials and letting others know about it.
6/1/2015 11:26:10	http://reddit.com/user/anarchyz11	GMT-4	21	VBA and VBScript primarily for Financial software.  But I took classes on HTML, JS, PHP, and CSS.  Wouldn't call me an expert, but I know enough to collaborate and know what's going on in any language of code.	No	Sounds like a lot of work.  My answer would be based off community appeal.  The interest should come before the idea.	Could get out of hand with trolls, but helping newer people is always good.	A moderator over at /r/Hardwareswap but I'm not looking for another jewel in the crown.  I used to play a Counter Strike ripoff game called Soldier Front competitively before realizing CSGO is a metric truckload better.  I know that doesn't technically qualify as playing the game for a long time, but there's definitely a lot of overlap.  I'm on reddit daily, this sub daily, work a normal 9-5 job in an office environment where being a childish troll isn't really an option, etc.  	7-9 months	A lot better than the other circlejerk subs that downvote unpopular ideas.  At the very least, everyone is objective about their thoughts.  
6/1/2015 11:32:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/rawraxel/	UTC+0	19	Basic HTML, QBasic, Basic Java & Python	I was an admin on a few servers in mw2 and have had my own server. It was hosted on AlterIW and i constantly banned hackers as i was the only admin available in this server which was almost constantly full due to it being located in the middle east ( not alot of servers there, this provided low ping for plenty of players) 	Personally i have not participated enough in this subreddit even tho i enjoy it as i have trouble running CS-GO with my current rig and it's hard to participate in a gaming community without actually playing the game so often and keeping myself up to date.	Same answer as before. 	I'm 18 and a half year old student studying International management. I've travelled alot and gained alot of cultural experience from all over the world. I've experienced middle eastern culture, South Asian, European, and american culture which makes me very effective at communicating. I'm also a trained facilitator who trains members of a team to learn to work together in a more productive and efficient manner by creating an objective environment where critical criticism is welcomed. I believe this few skills, among the many i have will be beneficial for the community and hopefully the mod team.  I look forward to hearing from you. :) 	13-18 months	I believe the community is rather objective and very interesting. I love the way they've intereacted with /r/leagueoflegends and has created a very positive impression about the community for me.
6/1/2015 11:37:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/noir173/	GMT-6	16	Nope	I have been an admin in many servers, however these were part of a seperate community (/r/ultrahardcore subreddit.)	I believe community night is a very integral part csgo community, that being said, I find that many newcomers are unaware that it exists while others are simply afraid of new people. 	Nothing wrong here, works well. 	As I previously stated I'm 16 and still in high school, although headed into my senior year. I live in southern USA. I've been on reddit for over a year now, but I don't post much simpl because I can't think of anything needing to be said. I comment sometimes and, yes I occasionally get upset with others, but I try to refrain from letting it out on reddit. As for CS:GO, I have 725 hours, and my current rank is DMG (it likes to fluctuate from dmg to mge.) I play with anyone who wants to invite me and is close to my rank. I do have some close friends who enjoy queuing with me and we have a team, sort of for fun, maybe for cevo. On another note, I do have many friends and I have had a lot of experience with the EU community due to the subreddit /r/ultrahardcore, which has many EU players and AU players. That's pretty much it for me; thanks for reading and I'll attempt to check my email as regularly as possible. Even if I am not chosen for a moderator position, thank you mods for everything you have done.   Sincerely,   noir173	7-9 months	To be truly honest, I love the community. I love how there are always a few funny posts joking about some funny play or some instance with a professional player. However, there is also a healthy mix of serious posts about hitboxes/glitches/boosts and many others (unreachable bombs is a popular one now.) People also post some helpful smokes and flashes and other tips which is a great help to others! (The kevlar was especially helpful to me :p)
6/1/2015 11:46:55	http://www.reddit.com/user/zack10024/	GMT-5	17	Yes. I have taken an HTML class last year in high school and within that class we also learn and bit of CSS. I have been trying to get into Javascript on my own using various coding websites!	I do not.	This is a very good idea. I have not been able to attend this yet but I do plan on it in the future. 	I love this. When I first started playing CS around 6 months ago, I always came back to this thread to look for ways to improve and gain knowledge about the game. 	I am a 17 year old high school student who is about to finish his junior year! I just recently got into the PC gaming community around this time last year and just built my first gaming PC last week! I am in love with it. From having to play CS on a laptop at 30 FPS, to now playing at 60 FPS 1080p (with vsync off it tops at 300 FPS) it is amazing. I am a very active redditor always browsing. I also have moderation experience. I currently am a mod of /r/FriendlyDebates and /r/laptops. These are both subreddits I have started with my friend and we are enjoying it a lot. Are biggest focus is on /r/laptops as we feel that it has the biggest growing opportunity. Thank you for taking time to read my application, and I hope you choose the right mod! :) - /u/zack10024	7-9 months	This community is great. I love that I can go to this subreddit and always learn new things about the game! The sidebar is also super helpful for new players and I always link my friends the sidebar if they are new to the game. 
6/1/2015 11:48:19	http://www.reddit.com/user/InvertedSkyTower/	GMT+0	19	Yes, I have knowledge of basic HTML coding.	Not CSGO but I was a mod on a Trouble in Terrorist Town server in GMod as well as ran my own server. I have also been a Mod and map builder in Minecraft but no longer play.		I think its a great way for new players to find out about the game and community. When I first started playing CSGO competitively I had no help as I didn't know the /r/globaloffensive subreddit existed and non of my friends played CSGO.	I'm a massive film and game geek and have a passion for visual effects. My favourite film is probably The Lord of The Rings: Return of the King as it was the film that made me love filmmaking and visual effects. Game wise I obviously like CSGO (no other FPS has really excited me since I started playing the comp game mode) but also recently I've started to get back into campaign driven games since I finished playing The Last of Us. Recently I've been into a little bit of games design and occasionally want to pull my hair out at it but its satisfying when it works. I'm also really into music. I play in a number of bands. I play drums, guitar, piano, bass and trumpet (some of them better than others).  In my internet life, I browse Reddit everday and frequent /r/globaloffensive as well as a number of other subreddits. I also frequent YouTube and occasionally post videos to my own channel.  Keep up the good work,  Alex	7-9 months	I think that the community in whole is fantastic. I love browsing other subreddits and seeing jokes from /r/globaloffensive. I find that occasionally I think it becomes a little bit circle jerky but its never anything on the scale of PCMR.
6/1/2015 11:50:57	http://www.reddit.com/user/eatingasquid/	UTC+0	16	Very little experience coding everything except Lua for gmod which is irrelevant under these circumstances. 	I have administrated CS:GO competitive community servers in the past amounst friends. My main administration work has been done over the past few years on the game Garry's mod, I have moderated at servers such as "The cube", Hexteria. Less significantly I've moderated at Monstergaming and flashback gaming. I have personally owned the communities JNGaming and Ruta's World, I currently own the community XYZGaming. I have managed the ex-community QGMod, which was the highest rating Gmod server of its time (In terms of player count on gametracker) Many of these communities had online forums which I helped moderate and keep professional managing both staff and community activity. 	I love the community nights hosted here. I have taken part in a few of them and have always had a really fun experience. This is something I would be really interested in taking part in if possible if I became a moderator, especially with my past administration experience of game servers. 	I don't really have any interest in Newbie Thursday.	Firstly, I'll go back over my server administration experience, then I'll talk about some of my business and writing experience. Over the past few years, I've been lucky enough to work with some real great amazing teams of people who have helped my become a much better person in general. I've helped the community side of many Gmod communities threw correct moderating techniques (Knowing how to handle certain issues and how they differ) I have transformed training of moderators in many communities (I've done this personally with watertight training programs, these staff training courses taught 'soon to be' moderators how to react in certain situations).  After this period of running Gmod communities, at the age of 15 I started up my own advertisement business which was called "Easy-Blogs". We set up advertisement spaces for small to medium sized businesses. This was a great experience for me as it taught me how to start something from nothing, it gave me more drive to succeed at what ever I did.  I spent a few months working at Gosugamers.net as a feature journalist writing mainly opinion pieces, however I also covered less viewed news articles. I spent a lot of this time in the skype chats working as a team to determine who would write what, and taking critisism of my writing which really helped my writing overall.  As Im coming to the end of year 11 (UK), I've just taken my GCSE's which Im hoping will be A/A*s.  I'll finish up by talking briefly about my CSGO experience. I have around 1600 hours in game so I know the game inside and out like a lot of the community. I also love watching the game played at the highest level, being part of Gosugamers was nice as it gave access to all of the top scene which was very interesting. I want to both continue playing CSGO and helping the CSGO community by becoming a moderator, using my past experience and learning much more in the process of doing so.  Thankyou for reading, and I hope I'll be joining you on the team very soon.    Eating a Squid.	10-12 months	I actually really like the community which I can't generally say about most. I like the fact that we have a diverse range of opinions which aren't censored mostly. I love the fact that we have a large number of people who can have a good sensible conversation whereas in other forums there are generally a low number of those wanted serious content. I also like the comedy aspect of a lot of the posts and responses. I've never had a negative experience with moderators of any community of reddit.
6/1/2015 11:55:17	http://www.reddit.com/user/caiks/	GMT-7	16	I know how to code in HTML and CSS. 	I was an administrator on a Garry's Mod TTT server for about 4 months. It was fairly difficult because there are a lot of people that break rules on those kinds of servers. From this I have better learned how to administrate online communities. The main community that used this server is probably the same one that uses CS:GO servers, almost all of my friends list owns Gmod and has played TTT.  	I believe that community night brings members of /r/globaloffensive together and also gives a chance for new maps on the workshop to be playtested to give map makers feedback. I think that this is something that needs to be kept around. 	Honestly, I think that Newbie Thursday is very repetitive but it does allow a forum for people to post very specific questions about the game. even with the repetition I think that it needs to stay around because so many new people start playing CS:GO every week and many new people join the /r/globaloffensive community every week. 	Hey guys! My name is Zach I am 16 years old and live in Colorado. I just finished my second year of High School with a 3.8 GPA. I first started playing CS:GO about 1 year ago and am currently a Legendary Eagle. I absolutely love to code in HTML/CSS and would love to work in that field as an on the side thing for small businesses in the future. My favorite color  is blue and my favorite food is Mac & Cheese. Thank you for your consideration. 	10-12 months	When I first joined the /r/globaloffensive community ~11 months ago it was very similar to how it is today, but with less "fluff". I do think that this is a change for the better. My overall thoughts on the community is that it is a great place to talk about CS:GO but sometimes it becomes kind of a circle jerk. 
6/1/2015 12:00:25	http://www.reddit.com/user/Vicariousjake/	GMT-5	23	Information systems degree, daily use of HTML/CSS through job. Limited experience with Ruby.	Owned and Ran DayZ Mod server for 12 Months, managed all aspects, database, teamspeak, server maintenance, backups. Servers were hosted via Vilayer.com. Servers had a constant populations of 30+ players, 50 being the max.	I have not participated in a community night yet, I am a fan of the idea though.	Big fan, I love helping out new players whenever possible, especially those who are willing to ask!	I am a 23yr Male who works in at a job that doesnt police the internet harshly. I check /r/GlobalOffensive for all CSGO news and it's my first place I check in the morning. I am semi new to the CS community, compared to others. I started with csgo about a year a go and have been addicted ever since. With 1260 hours played I consider myself to be fairly knowledge of the game but still learning every day. I have always been the leader type, whether it being admining my DayZ Mod server or corralling my friends in a competitive match. The CSGO comunity is one that I consider myself a part and it would truly be a joy to help the community I am so fond of.	7-9 months	I think they can be a little...extremely harsh to new players and offer no constructive criticism, beyond "you suck". Beyond that it's a great community!
6/1/2015 12:05:46	http://www.reddit.com/user/palandra	GMT+10	25	No experience in coding sadly! Just your classic Reddit BBCode type stuff, and some real real basic HTML.	I've been the admin of several servers over the years. Most were purely team servers that I rented through server hosts such as Internode, Streamline, GameArena etc.  In 2007 I was one of a couple of admins of a community WC3 1.6 Server which was heaps of fun and very popular. I believe it was 24 slotted and was the only WC3 server around so was always packed.	Great! If the demand is there I'd really love to try and set up some more Southern Hemisphere based Community Nights, and try and bring some more of the Australian competitive scene over.	I think it's surprisingly useful. Regardless of how long Newbie Thursday runs, it seems to remain an incredibly popular service. I've helped out a couple of times in the past and I sort of feel guilty I don't give it more time.  I suppose I'm more interested in the self-posts, but if I was a moderator I'd certainly make it a priority.  That being said, I've been surprised at the little tidbits of information I've picked up when I do read it.	So I'm an Australian CS player, writer, actor and I'd love to give back to this community! I'm also super passionate about gaming and the Australian CS scene.  I played CS since 1.3, and competitively since 1.6. I was in an Aussie CS:S pro team called x7 in 2009/10. That was fun, but I had to quit as I was studying Performance full time.  During 2009 I was also an Admin of GotGames.com.au. At the time, GotGames was the largest Australian Gaming Website besides Cybergamer, and the GotGames forums were where the entire Australian CS community lived.  I was in a paid position as Content Manager of GotGames for approximately a year after oldmate SPUNJ left the position to pursue his career. It was a good time, and probably the golden era for a lot of old Aussie cs players. The community was outrageous. Full of life, the forums were so busy and so crazy. People were toxic, but also were hilarious. I really miss that time. We did a really bad job in moderating it though. Really, really bad. We were too young and too involved to really get perspective on what we were doing. I wrote some articles which sort to address the issues latent in the community and it worked for a while but habits die hard I guess. Also we were largely understaffed. Eventually we were bought out by another party and GotGames died. The community moved to GTeSports and Cybergamer, and that's where we are now.  So yeah, after that I studied Performance and Creative Writing. I'm articulate and outgoing. I think I see the best in people, and I struggle with being unempathetic online. When I was growing up I think I must have been really affected by conversations I had with people online, and now I can't help but think about the fact that people can actually really care about the interactions they have with total strangers over the internet. It's crazy. And it's friggin beautiful man!  When I was doing Honours in my degree, /r/GlobalOffensive was my homepage. Not even kidding. It was a dark, dark time. Ha! I'm really familiar with the subreddit and I'd really love to give back to it. I already trawl through 'New', and I read the comments of pretty much every post. /r/GlobalOffensive is my house these days.  Let me know if you want to talk! I'm super keen, even if Moderating ain't on the table. I can do all kinds of crazy things! 	2-3 years	When I first joined /r/GlobalOffensive I think it was a little more innocent, and a little less generalised.  By this I mean the community has grown and as a result, the discussions, the memes, the references etc. Often seem to relate to other games, other communities and other subreddits. As we grow larger and begin to take on more players from games like Dota2 and LoL, we also take on a little bit of their mindset and vibe.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think our demographic has certainly gotten younger and more populated. As a result I think the Mod Team has to work a little harder at policing and strangely, be a little looser. I'm not sure. I'm a pretty merciful guy I guess, but some of these members I'm sure are only young teenagers. They need people to guide them in how to behave online. It's the one thing I feel was sorely missed in the Australian Counterstrike scene. I don't offer a way to do this, but I think it's a discussion that maybe needs to happen.  Overall, I quite honestly think you guys do a good job. I offered to join you guys as a moderator a long time ago, maybe when I first subscribed to GlobalOffensive. I noticed there wasn't really any active moderators on during the times I browsed, largely because I was Aussie, but despite that fact, I really think the way you've handled the community is pretty stella! 
6/1/2015 12:08:37	http://reddit.com/u/Rongmario	GMT+1	16	I used to mod Minecraft, this got me into Java, I touched on HTML because of high school courseworks. At the moment using Python because of high school as well.	I used to admin Minecraft servers, no CS:GO ones. Minecraft servers are usually harder to admin since there can be a lot of console errors and compatibility issues and usually people have worse laptops playing on MC, so support is big part in admining these servers. I should do good on CS:GO servers, more trolls? Not a problem if I'm here :P	I've never actually been to one because my PC isn't stable at the moment (keep crashing can't even play competitive), but I would join when I install Mumble, but even before that need to fix PC XD Community Night is great on exploring these new maps and I believe we can do scrims between some smaller teams that's consistently on reddit and the people should be able to watch.	I like it, really offers the answers to the newcomers and definitely helps existing people on some questions they need clearing up as well.	There's really nothing haha. Live in the UK, half Taiwanese, half Kashmiri. One of the bigger modders in Minecraft (Behind the scenes) Going pro in CS:GO, nearly there haha	7-9 months	I love it, really do, not lying (srs). The mods currently are awesome since they are easy to chat to and don't seem restricted like other 'mods' that I've seen else where, making the title 'mod' seem very VERY harsh and a character that should enforce a very strict rule set.
6/1/2015 12:15:06	https://www.reddit.com/user/McSpike/	GMT+2	15	Yes. I have VERY basic knowledge of HTML and C# due to a few courses I've taken.	Yes. I was a moderator on a TF2 fun server for around 7 months. I stepped down from my position due to me quitting TF2.  Basically, it was a server that focused more on people assing around and micspamming than the actual game itself.	It seems like a nice concept. I haven't been able to take part due to school so far but now I'm on a vacation for 10 weeks so maybe I can check it out.	Well, as far as I know a lot of people fairly new to the game check out this subreddit so it's a great idea to have a weekly thread for them to ask questions on.	I'm a very talkative person who likes mature conversations. I usually am not serious about stuff that isn't serious and I know how to laugh at myself. I enjoy both competitive and fun games.  People have told me that I'm fun to talk and do stuff with. I'm usually quite honest about stuff due to me being the worst liar ever.  Also, I have a horrible Finnish accent that a lot of people seem to like for a reason I don't understand.	7-9 months	Majority of the people here are nice. Sure, some are complete idiots or trolls who hate on people new to the game etc but I've enjoyed my stay here.
6/1/2015 12:15:41	https://reddit.com/u/Virgil_Fromage/	GMT+0	16	I have dabbled in HTML as I am an active user and administrator of the forum that the gaming community I play in runs. I am competent in HTML and can understand basic things such as text formatting and embedding various objects.  Apart from this small amount of experience in HTML, I am mostly a newbie when it comes to coding.	I have a lot of experience administrating servers, as I was a Manager of the gaming community I play in up until recently when I stepped down as exams were coming up. This community is called Gentlemen Gamers and runs a total of three servers and a TeamSpeak server which most of us use for VOIP. This server did once run seven servers until the owner's budget was cut. We used to have Trouble in Terrorist Town, Deathrun, Jailbreak, Stop it Slender!, Melonbomber, Toybox to name but a few, however only the first three remain now.  During my time administrating this community, I built the TeamSpeak server, setting up all of the permissions and making sure that everything worked properly. I also worked on the support team during this time, replying to e-mails with requests to be unbanned and complaints etc. The community also has a forum that is powered by Vanilla Forums and this was set up by me and a few other staff members during the time I administrated.  I also spent a lot of time moderating in-game, trying to make sure that the servers were not full of toxic players that would ruin the game for others. I tried to make it so it was a pleasant experience for all.  Here is a link to the steam group page and the forum (my Steam Nickname is Jonny): http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GMGGamers , http://forums.gentlemen-gamers.com/	Although I have no participated in any Community Nights, I feel that they are a great way to bring the community together and to get them to interact with each other. I think that a group of people playing games together can forge strong bonds between them and create lasting friendships that will be remembered for a lifetime. As well as being fun, it	I love Newbie Thursday! Having played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for over a year now, I feel that it is a great way for better, more experienced players to share their tips with the lesser-skilled members of the community. I often find myself learning new things when I read through the comments section. I feel that it is a fantastic way to get people to pass on their expertise and make the whole community play better as a whole.	I'm 16 years old and live in the North of England. I'm currently doing my GCSE examinations and have about three weeks of exams left. After this I'll have finished for summer and will have about three months of free time on my hands. I've been using Reddit for a little over a year now but I've been subscribed to /r/GlobalOffensive for less than that. I recently created a newer account as my old account I made the mistake of giving it my full real name and didn't feel comfortable with that. I'm a bit of lurker when it comes to Reddit, but recently I've been trying to find more places to comment and reply to people's questions and shitposts alike.  I usually find myself staying up late at night browsing Reddit and I've loved the time I have spent in the /r/GlobalOffensive community so far. I hope that you consider my application.  Thank you!	7-9 months	I've only posted once in the /r/GlobalOffensive community and my post didn't get much traction but I feel as a whole there are two types of people that can be found. There are the people who like to help others if they have any questions or concerns and there are the jokers who always make posts fun to read. I find the balance of relevant posts and comical posts to be great as I can read through the recent threads without finding myself overwhelmed with either type of thread.   I think as well as the posts there is also a lot of other useful information such as match updates and fixtures. I find that the post-match discussions that are had are intellectual and are always fun to read through.  I find that it is moderated well and I never find myself looking at posts that break this subreddit's rules and reddiquette. I think it is a great community full of great individuals and I would love to be a part of the mod team!
6/1/2015 12:15:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/MalkierriKing/	GMT-5	26	Basic HTML and C (embedded systems an the like)	Not recently, but way back when in the CS 1.6 and source days (I have a 9, very neraly 10, years of service badge for my steam account thanks to Counter-Stike)		This is an excellent discussion thread and one of the reasons I started playing Counter-Strike again recently. I found a few great tips on pro-matches to watch and how things work that got me excited to play again. Having a forum where users, be they new or experienced, can ask questions that have been bugging them without fear of belittlement is exceptionally encouraging and good for the growth of the game.	My background in computer games stems all the way back to the original Nintendo GameBoy. Ever since playing Tetris 2, Super Wario and, of course, the Pokemon series I've been hooked. I began playing Counter-Strike in the very early 2000s and re-visited it once the Steam distribution platerform for auto-updates was released. Since then I've been in and out of PCs, consoles and board games as well as a myriad of sports in which I captained various teams.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, as well as a degree in Business Management. On the back of my studies I have spent time working in Oil and Gas construction in Australia, although my wife and I needed a change of scenery and now live in Montreal Canada working part-time and focusing on other endeavours. For me, that includes video games. I'd love to work in the video game industry and be more intimately involved in esports as I believe it's an industry that needs support and that I have a lot to offer. Beginning with working as a moderator for /r/GlobalOffensive is a great way to get in to the industry while providing the community with a competent and understanding communicator with experience in conflict resolution and the confidence to assert myself.  Relevant to my availabilities for moderation, I currently only work 15-20 hours per week and spend a lot of my spare time perusing the internet and playing either CS:GO or Dota 2 (I'm a sucker for competitive games). I'm more than happy to dedicate some of that time to assisting this forum to grow and develop even further than it already has. Hopefully I can even network with some of the right people to make inroads on working in the esports industry.	4-6 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is simiar to any moderated online community. It has its mix of power users, casual users, readers and trolls. Players posting here seeking a little bit of fame often get the flame that goes with that, but in general I think most users are mostly genuine. There is robust discussion about gameplay and tactics, hints tips and tricks, professional matches, potential improvements and community contributions (maps, workshop items and even independant artwork/features). In addition there is enough humour and flavour to make it interesting for those that don't take it so seriously. Overall it is a very benficial resource for the community and something that I'd love to play an active role in.
6/1/2015 12:21:45	http://www.reddit.com/user/WayTooFR35H/	GMT-4	15	I currently work at Emagination Computer Camps (a nerdy computer camp with multiple camps around the country, I go to the Connecticut one) as a Programming Assistant. And to answer your question, yes, I have taken a course in Python (I took this course at Emagination) and am very good with Java (took a year long course at my school, Dalton).	No, but I want to.	I personally love it because I get to see the community come together and agree on things (and usually not argue for once for the most part like the rest of reddit).	I personally don't have a view on it, as I usually don't take a part of it.	If you see above that I have around 13-18 months on the subreddit, it's because I used to have a different reddit account back when I had a dumb username (http://www.reddit.com/user/FL35HWOUND). My steam account was originally made to play Black Ops 2 zombies after I had got it for Christmas in 2012, where I named my account ZombieNuker2025 (I wasn't very original back then haha). This evolved to FL35HWOUND after this one skype call where my friends and I realized that I needed a non Black Ops 2 only steam name. We kept spouting out random crap until my friend said “’tis but a flesh wound,” where I then translated it into the internet version (me making a joke of how many people replace letters with numbers) and it was thus FL35HWOUND. I then transformed this to FL35H because it was just short and sweet, later realizing how the whole FL35H and FL35HWOUND as a name thing was weird in general. I changed it to FR35H, which I still quite frequently use, but it is 1 letter short of meeting the requirements for a username on most sites (such as twitch.tv for example). I changed it to WayTooFR35H from here, thus my current and forever lasting username :) Anyways, let's go away from my name story now. I have a bit over 300 hours now in CS:GO, but have been playing it a lot more frequently within the past couple of days. I have a stream (twitch.tv/waytoofr35h) and have a lot of dedication to this. I am always playing with my friends- very rarely am I by myself. My steam account: http://steamcommunity.com/id/WayTooFR35H  Last but not least, I just want to say that in the case that I do not become a mod (which is a lot more likely than for me actually becoming one), I would like to say thank you so much for controlling this subreddit and keeping it alive over the past couple of years. I am always on it and having a blast and can't wait to be uploading demos soon once I fully figure out my issue with ShadowPlay. I tip my hat at thee and wish you a good day :)	13-18 months	I think the community is better than most communities, but I personally despise the smurfs, cheaters, DDOSers, trolls, people who discriminate others (whether based on voice, race, religious purposes, etc.), people who group harass so they can't be kicked, people who spam binds, people who use the P90 (don't take this seriously haha), and people who think they're the leader and the team and harass you for being a "low fragger." I would do anything I can to get rid of the smurfs, cheaters, and DDOSers, although I obviously can't change how people are. As I've been ranking up, I've been seeing less and less of all of these types of people, and I've always had a positive attitude when it comes to the majority of the (/r/)CS:GO community (the good side).
6/1/2015 12:27:15	http://www.reddit.com/u/u3p0van	UTC+1	16		I've been an admin on plenty of CS 1.6 Servers & such, no experience in CS:GO though.			A 16 Year old from Serbia. I generally spend a lot of time on the computer, and that is actually one of the reasons why i applied for the mod position. I can spend a LOT of time online, and with the coming summer vacation i'll be online for ~6-12 hours a day. My application might seem a lot weaker than some of the other contestants ( I suppose ) because of my lack of general programming skills and such, but i'm eager to learn. As a mod i'd be online for a big portion of the day, and i'll frequently be checking and deleting unwanted posts from the "new" tab. Even if i don't qualify for being a mod, i'd like to thank you for your time and i hope that you find a good mod.	10-12 months	It's generally an okay community compared to other subreddits. (/r/Leagueoflegends for an example). I find that the people will be a lot more helpful and informative on /r/globaloffensive, than on most other gaming subreddits.
6/1/2015 12:27:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/LexoEU	GMT+1	18	I have basic understandings of HTML and PHP which I practiced regularly during my time at college but haven't used it in a while. It use to be a hobby of mine but playing CS:GO and Sports overtook this hobby and I left it in the background.	Hosting and Admining Servers is something that I am currently evolved with on a daily basis. I work for GameAgentsTV which hosts CS:GO Tournaments such as Balkan Championship (Season 1 + 2) and GameAgents League which have both been featured on CSGOLounge and streamed to 15,000+ viewers.  My role usually is to organize the matches between the two teams such as the time the matches will be played and then sorting out the maps using the VETO system. Finally, I spectate the matches while they are being streamed on Hitbox to ensure that everything runs smoothly and fix issues when players aren't happy with the service.  Server Hosting Provider: CKRAS What Was Hosted: Balkan Championship + GameAgents League Communities Used: Dignitas, Games2, Copenhagen Wolves, I Got Game and may other successful organisations.	Community Nights are great for Reddit users to get more involved with other Reddit users and to come together and play in relaxed environments. Its great to see users coming together to play casual or competitive and playing the game for fun which removes the hostile environment that is displayed within CS:GO servers.  I have been apart of one Community Night in the past and it was really great to meet members that I had never spoken to before and have a fun time relaxing playing CS:GO.	Newbie Thursday allow new users to the sub-Reddit and new CS:GO players to learn more about the game to help them adapt and become better players. It allows users to come together as a community and provide help for people with questions, strategies and anything Counter-Strike related.  Newbie Thursday was something that I use to read just to pick up a few tips that I had never thought about before but I now read it to see what new players are stuck on and usually help players in-game that I spot doing these mistakes.	I have recently finished college studying Information Communication and Technology Systems and Mathematics. Counter-Strike and the sub-reddit has been a big part of my life while growing up and I would love to return the service by helping out new and existing users.  I am currently very active within the eSports scene for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as I have a position within GameAgentsTV which streams competitive professional matches within different tournaments and leagues. I help out in-game providing help and support to the players and ensuring that everything runs smoothly on the server. Secondly, I am also the Managing Director for I Got Game eSports who are a Professional Romanian Team who compete at a high level against other professional teams around the world.  I enjoy spending time doing community work and meeting new people so this role would be perfect for me to actually get stuck in and get more involved with the users on the sub-reddit.  Thanks for reading my application :)	19-24 months	I think the Global Offensive community is ran by a successful group of moderators who all actively partake in their roles and try their best. There is the odd occasion that hateful comments and rule breaking threads appear for a long period of time but Moderators aren't God, I understand that monitoring constantly is sometimes and issue but the community still runs smoothly.  The community likes to get involved with each other by commenting on threads and chatting about their own personal experiences which is a nice setting because it just brings everyone closer together and makes the game better as a whole. The threads shown within the community are always new and interesting and its great to see players finding something new or helping each other out to make their experience of the game better.
6/1/2015 12:30:04	http://www.reddit.com/user/Paradoxous/	GMT+10	20	I have a light to medium experience in HTML, Javascript and Visual Basic from my first year of IT at university.	I unfortunately don't have much experience with admining servers.	I haven't got much to say about this. It's an awesome event. I wish I could say more about it, but I haven't got first hand experience as from what I've seen only NA and EU are hosted.	Only being a Nova 4 myself, it's a regular read for me. The higher ranks are usually very well spoken and have a good attitude towards sometimes obvious questions.	I am from Queensland, Australia. I currently am a 1st year university student (switched degrees from IT to Science) and so anytime that isn't exam block I spend on Reddit or playing games. Needless to say I am mostly a lurker, which is probably an unattractive quality for a mod. However not everyone has loud personality and I don't believe in changing the way I act IRL to online.  Being a lurker mean't I only made an account 2 years ago despite browsing reddit for around 1 and half years prior, so needless to say I've been around for a little while by any standards. I currently support CLG (I came to CS from LoL). Im not sure what else to say! I love Counter-Strike, I love this community and I want to do my part to make it even better! Please consider me for a moderator.	10-12 months	I love the community here. It honestly brings a sigh of relief when I finish browsing /r/leagueoflegends and move onto this sub. The diversity of content that gets to the front page is refreshing (even the knock knock/joke threads). I would love to be able to help make such an awesome community even better.
6/1/2015 12:45:23	http://reddit.com/user/Big_Booty_Pics	GMT+5	18	Very basic Javascript, Java and Python	I helped admin a BF4 server with my friend from school. We ran a 64 player Metro server with no explosives plugin installed. Basically we just patrolled and kept people from doing boosts, glitches and exploits. Occasional language/racism moderation but it wasn't too much of an issue.	I think the Community Night is a great idea and it is definitely enjoyable when we play random maps and just try to have fun.	I have never participated in Newbie Thursday so I really don't have any comments on this. 	18, going to Ohio State next year, studying computer science and finance, LEM in MM, 10-12 RWS on ESEA depending on how good of a week i'm in. Played 1 season of CEVO open and 1 season of CEVO-IM as a main awper. 2700-2800 csgo hours, played highschool football and baseball and becoming a semi-pro csgo player while I go to college would be enjoyable for me. 	10-12 months	Since this doesn't hurt my chance, FUCK YOU MODS, ESPECIALLY YOU JPON9. JK, /r/globaloffensive is my favorite subreddit. Overall I think the subreddit is a very nice community to get involved in but I have noticed over the past year or so that it can get VERY circlejerky and some people realllly like to work that downvote arrow for very mundane things. 
6/1/2015 12:46:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/ScHn3tZ4t0r/	UTC+1	16	very little Javascript.	no, but i want to in the future	they are awesome. So many friendly people, you learn so much stuff from more skilled players. Reddit is like a brotherhood.	They are great. If google couldn't help, reddit will :D	When i started playing cs go, i was a noob. I was the biggest noob ever (silver 1), couldn't hit a single shot, played with 4200 dpi. When i saw this subreddit, i improved very much and r/globaloffensive is one of the reasons i still play the game, even if i prefere other games atm. 	19-24 months	most people are relaxed and are just good people, but there are a few people who think they are superior than others (lawl noob only silver 3/ omg noob 200 hours in cs). They get downvoted to hell, but they still exist in this awesome subreddit. 
6/1/2015 12:49:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/YinxuU	GMT+2	20	I do not have any experience in coding.	I'm a guest-admin on 2 different servers from the same clan. They're set up for 12v12 and 13v13 casual competitive. It's a German community but we have people from all over Europe on our servers.  As a guest-admin I have all the rights to kick, ban, silence players or whatever is needed to provide a nice atmosphere for other players. However, I did not setup the server nor do I understand a lot about setting one up so I can't really explain all the plug-ins running on it. We recently installed the Admin ESP plug-in to help us detect possible wallhackers faster.  Here are the 2 IPs if you wanna take a look. My names "eVo" in case you come across me.  #1 connect 94.249.140.41:27015 #2 connect 94.249.140.68:27015  	I love the community nights. I've only recently started taking part in them and I really enjoyed it. It's a shame there's always a couple smurfs writing lower ranks next to their names when joining mumble. It's not taking over though so it doesn't ruin the fun at all.  Playtesting new maps is really nice as well. Something new, something different. Not the usual maps we all are used to.	I'm usually just lurking them to see if I can grab a tip or two from the given answers. That said, It's a really good idea and I think a lot of people are profiting from it.  And most importantly, it allows you to ask pretty specific questions and you'll still get an answer to it.    	Well...my name's Thomas, I'm 20 and I live in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm currently working as a graphics artist/designer.  I've only started playing CS about a year and a half ago and already worked myself up from Silver 4 to DMG. "Joined" Reddit a bit over a year ago but was only lurking for the first couple months. Today not a single day passes where I don't spend a lot of my time browsing Reddit although still not a heavy commenter.  Other big hobbies are football (soccer), hockey and FIFA on PS4. The first two are probably easy to spot going through my comment history ( ._.) =D   Why do I wanna become a Mod on r/GlobalOffensive?  As stated above I spend a lot of my time browsing Reddit and GlobalOffensive is one of my most favourite subs amongst r/pcmasterrace (not one of the circlejerk guys in case it makes a difference) and r/AskReddit. I'd love to help keep the community as awesome as it is and maybe make it even better in the future.   Do I have any other experiences as a moderator on or off Reddit?  Not moderating any other subs on Reddit.  Since july 2013 I've been a moderator on the biggest FIFA Ultimate Team related website called Futhead. User profile: http://www.futhead.com/user/TehSmoody/  Some of my tasks are going through squads and comments and moderate them if needed, read through user created player reviews and accept/decline them or generally try and help the community where needed on the main page or the forums.   That's about it. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.	7-9 months	Overall an awesome community. Really helpful and nice to eachother. I don't see a lot of negative things which is really good to see.  The only time I was a bit annoyed about it was when everyone went on the witch hunt with flushas demos and the general Fnatic hate back then. I'm not a big fan of Fnatic myself but it's not necessary to go on a witch hunt.
6/1/2015 12:55:34	http://www.reddit.com/user/crnhndrsn/	UTC+1	15	Yes, Python and a lil bit of HTML. I did it at school for a bit. Nothing major :(	Minecraft and Gmod	Meh.	Good idea. I like it. Although I never got answered... 	I like playing CSGO. I am MGE and some how haven't been deranked. I get carried a lot and really like this: http://i.imgur.com/IIBlvE3b.jpg   Thanks, From Ciaran :D	4-6 months	Decent for the most part.
6/1/2015 12:56:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/frankmite	GMT+1	9	Yes I once made a game on scratch	Maybe	Silver nubs meeting night	Should be newbie monday	Im catsexual	5+ years	Polite
6/1/2015 12:57:34	http://www.reddit.com/user/Tms-	GMT+0	19	Yes, I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS. I have had a little experience with Jquery but not much.	Yes, I have run servers for different events including clan events Reddit Community Nights and some public servers. They was hosted with a host and had full FTP access to them.	I am one of the moderators for the EU Community Night along side Vizo and DMF and have been for around 3 months. I think the Community Night is a good place for new and experienced players to have a good time and to also meet new players that they can play with outside of the Community Night. I know i have met many people there i play with regularly outside of the Community Night its self.	I think that its a good idea to help out new players who are struggling to grasp the fundamentals of the game and helps to clear the sub Reddit of the same sort of questions. 	Im 19 from the UK, currently studying networking (CISCO) at college and will be done in the next month. Im normally lurking on reddit most of the day i have a few accounts the one i use now is due to changing my name so i changed all of the things that go with it including reddit. However i dint really have an account on reddit for a long time. I work for a school freelancing doing networking/coding and a few other jobs. When im not working im normally playing csgo or just trading and browsing the interwebs. Also im GE-SMFC so i can help carry the next staff cup.......... jk xD Iv been playing csgo for just over a year after moving from other fps games. Not really sure what else to say so ill leave it here and look forward to a response.	7-9 months	I think for the most part it is a good place the /r/GlobalOffensive community is alot better than the CSGO community in general and having it helps the CSGO community and its sort of the light at the end of a dark tunnel.   
6/1/2015 12:58:15	http://www.reddit.com/user/adlp/	UTC-7	23	I am a bbcode wizard.	Nope	It's cool that players can come together from this subreddit and play on a consistent basis.	Great for new players of course.	I currently work full time in Las Vegas. I'm a college student that is going back to school for the fall semester. I have a lot of hobbies, and following esports is one of them. I'm way into Super Smash Bros Melee and I compete and interact with community figures on a semi regular basis. I spend plenty of time browsing reddit and am active in comment sections. I'd guess I'm generally well liked. I'm fluent in English and Spanish.  Thanks.	2-3 years	I've been a reddit for years and have witnessed some terrible moderation where mod teams has been unfair to their users. From what I can tell from my years browsing r/globaloffensive, I can say the current mods here are doing a great job. It would be cool to mod with them.  Over time I've noticed the contrast between ESEA players and other pugging client users. With constant drama coming from ESEA's actions, I see users getting heated over ESEA's limbo position to remain the pinnacle of skill for CSGO in NA. This wasn't really a big deal until the bitcoin fiasco began.  As a regular user I generally loathe screenshot threads and art submissions; I like to actually read and discuss csgo news and mechanics about the game instead of indulging in low quality content. That's just personal preference though.
6/1/2015 13:07:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/Zuzahin	UTC+1	20	I'm afraid I don't.	I hosted my own server with my brother back in the 1.6 and Source days, in Source my best friend joined in on the party, and we just had a clan going on, with PCW's and a general community. Right now the closest thing to that is my current teams private 128-tick server that we use to practice smokes and just dick around on.	I love them. Absolutely love them. I wish I could participate, but work and school gets in the way of staying up too late for the American community schedule. :(	I love helping people as much as the next guy, so I think a venue for people to be able to reach out and get help is a great initiative. 	I'm a 20 year old college student working freelance with my own company. Procrastination is something I should have a gold medal in, but I mostly spend it on Reddit, which is why I enjoy moderating a few different Subreddits. /r/Wince and /r/ColorizedHistory (The latter of which I created) are my 2 main Subreddits, I contribute and comment on both here and there (Not so much on wince, not so much to say really), but I primarily stick to ColorizedHistory, which is essentially my work as well.   I've been playing Counter Strike since I was 10 or 11 and I saw my brother playing it, and as a little brother, I had to have what he had, and my dad bought me my own version, but I only ever played the bots - my brother used to beat me something serious, but he also had a lot more training than me, lol. Fun times. 	7-9 months	I feel as if a lot of people are critical of this 'idea' of the regular GlobalOffensive Reddit user, when in reality it's a couple of bad apples messing up the bunch. The community seems like a great one overall, I haven't really felt like I was unwelcome, even when I was sporting a Gold Nova flair, it's one of the easier communities to comment in I feel.
6/1/2015 13:49:16	http://www.reddit.com/user/takibo/	GMT-5	21	Very basic, Went to college for computer science but never continued through, Did some basic HTML classes. Not much.	Yes, plenty. Have played CS since 2000, and online CS since 2005, Have ran and moderated dozens and dozens of community servers in CS:S	Great way to get the community together.	Seems like every question people have are already asked in threads, But i can see some people saving their questions for newbie thursdays, have helped a few people there.	A little about my CS experience: Have played cs since 2000, Online CS started since 2005, and competitive CS i started in 2009, Have been playing on several tournaments and have played ESEA for about 10 seasons now, Have been to LAN tournaments, winning a few, placing 2nd in a few (Have a few pictures but cant post them here :( )   I'm very attached to the pro scene; Matter of fact several of the new top players i have played with, (like roca,fugly,rush) I have played with in Teams and have a little bit of a connection with several top players   about me: - I'm brazilian (but live in Florida, USA now), I speak a total of 3 languages - I'm extremely geeky. I'm basically on the internet 24/7 - Have had a few AMA's on global offensive, one of them got to the first page one time i believe. - Had a stickied Global Elite adopt thread on adoptasilver. I love helping the community. - Outside of the computer, I'm a personal trainer. Have a girlfriend who lives a country away currently. - One time i made an AMA (like i said earlier) and i offered help to anyone at anytime, and i got over 150+ adds on steam lol, matter of fact i still have about 100 /r/globaloffensive users on my steam added still! haha	7-9 months	Honestly? I haven't gotten many complaints. It is beautifully ran. No criticizing that comes to mind.
6/1/2015 13:45:52	http://reddit.com/user/MolimoPlays	UTC+2	14	No, unfortunately not.	Have been admin on a few Danish servers. Usually just the ones hosted from another site. The community were probably younger Danish people with less mm experience. 	Really nice seeing the community come together! Would love to help	Amazing seeing people helping others out.	So, im a 14 year old boy from Denmark who loves to play Counter-Strike. Been playing it for 7 months and i play almost everyday and browse the reddit page even more. I can be really mature and take it seriously  as i know it is a serious job. I'm always able to help someone out if they need it etc. and will always stay positive towards the community.	4-6 months	Sometimes they are a bit hars, especially when someone post something they make they can be pretty evil. But all around really nice actually.
6/1/2015 13:47:27	http://www.reddit.com/user/Danthehumann/	GMT+2	17	Basic grade 10 Java	Not in Global Offensive	Its a good way for the r/GlobalOffensive community to get to know one another. Although I haven't attended many, it's good fun to chat to other members of the sub.	I personally think it is a bit repetitive. Maybe once every 2 weeks instead 	Im Dan, from South Africa. I'm currently doing my A Levels. I have played CS:GO for about 2 and a bit years now and I currently play for a team called APG. Atlas, who are going to the ESWC lan qualifiers in Johanmesburg next weekend. If we win, then it's a one way ticket( and return flights hopefully ;) ) to ESWC for us. I have over 2000 hours on GO and I really enjoy playing the game. 	13-18 months	The community has really grown from way back when. Sure, there are some pitch fork moments and some negativity, but all in all I enjoy the community as most members are very chatty and easy to talk to, as well as some top quality banter being exchanged..
6/1/2015 13:51:05	http://reddit.com/u/sloth_on_meth	GMT+1	16	Yes, some basic HTML and CSS, i'm ashamed of this abomination but i made this: http://sam.burkels.com/index2.html  So yeah. Basic.   I've also done a lot of automoderator coding for /r/nexus5, and some C#.Net	Yes, i have admined some minecraft servers in the past, mostly freebuild, and my job was mostly banning griefers and calming down arguments.	I love playing in the community night, if only i had more time so i could play more often..	I don't really know what newbie thursday is.	I'm a 16 year old geek from the Netherlands, and discovered reddit 6 months or so ago. I since then actively participated in /r/nexus5, but i noticed something wasn't going too well over there. The moderators didn't really actively keep an eye on the subreddit and the same questions got posted over and over again. I then posted a thread "This subreddit needs moderation" The mods replied, made me a mod, and since then two other mods were added to the team. I worked on automoderator a lot to answer the common questions and refer users to the faq. I was getting a lot of positive feedback from the community, and i still love doing it even though it has its downsides :)	4-6 months	I think the community is pretty biased against lower rank players, which is understandable. However, there's always a couple users willing to help you out, and that's a great thing.
6/1/2015 13:59:10	http://www.reddit.com/user/xPURExSHOCKx/	GMT-3	16	Little HTML  		Played a couple of times, enjoyed playing but somethings are a bit... crazy. Like if you get there a bit early, the mumble is one big shouting contest. Once you get split up and some of the people disperse its better.	I like these threads a lot. It helps people newer to csgo and you can learn something in there that you couldn't have known prior too	Just a guy from Canada looking to help out the community anyway I can. Been playing csgo on and off for the past two years, and am very happy I started taking the game more seriously. I am still in school, but I am on this sub probably around 2-3 hours a day, but if i were to get a mod position i would actually have a reason to be on the sub so I would be able to be on more if needed. Honestly I don't post that much in the sub, maybe a comment here and there but I do try to help out whenever I can and I would love to be able to call myself a mod of my favorite sub. I do hope you will take my application into consideration and you wont judge me based on my age, I do believe if you gave me the chance I could show you what I can do to help out and improve the community if possible! Thanks -Myles	10-12 months	Well, sometimes people are quite toxic, but you can find that in every other sub if you look hard enough. I think this community can be very harsh towards new players, but again you have people who try their best to help when they get the chance to balance it out. The community probably looks like its in shambles from an outsider looking in. (Before this was such a big community) Every time something got posted on this sub that made it to the frontpage was drama. Pro player vacbans, throwing scandals and such. Now its gotten to the point where you will see csgo posts on the frontpage that are positive, which i think is great. All in all this sub is fairly good, i'm sure that you can get nit picky with it and point out all the flaws but like every other sub you could do the same.
6/1/2015 14:05:17	http://reddit.com/user/cLaunnn/	GMT+1	23	I am a trained software developer in mainly C/C++ but I had HTML, Java, Javascript and Python in school. I can adapt to other languages pretty fast and can learn them pretty much during implementation. I have 3 years experience working as a software developer.	It was my responsibility to do server stuff in all the teams I have played in from back in 2007, I can handle servers.	It's pretty much the only thing that tests maps properly and gives a posibility to see if they are even remotely competitively viable, it's a good thing sadly they are mostly during my own teams practice times.	Excellent idea, I think it was taken from another gaming related sub right? The League sub maybe? Anyways it's a good thing and I have answered some questions myself.	I am 23 from Munich, Bavaria, Germany. I play CS:GO on a team in ESL Major GER, ESL Open League and ESEA Open. I have also played on multiple teams in CS:S on a fairly high level inside the german scene, which was way stronger back then, then it is compared to now in CS:GO. When I'm not playing or watching CS:GO I am studying electrical engineering and work as a software developer(basically idling /r/globaloffensive). I am a mod over at /r/csgocritic where I have helped them with structuring submissions and have done a lot of reviews in form of a video myself. I don't really know what more to tell you guys but if you have any questions feel free to send me a message on reddit.	4-6 months	It's a strange crowd with vastly different oppinions on most subjects but due to the nature of reddit posts that don't contribute or have no place on this sub are kept down, also thanks to the mods. It's hard to have an oppinion/thoughts on a community that large but I think it's importance as a whole to the CS:GO scene has been increasing rapidly since I started visiting it more frequently, from what I've seen.
6/1/2015 14:05:59	http://reddit.com/u/AlenGaming	GMT+2	16	ASP, HTML, PHP, SQL, JAVA, C, CSS, JAVAFX, BASIC	I host right now 2 CSGO Gameservers. 1 Headshot only Public and 1 Private War	Sorry never been on a Community Night.	Sorry never been on a Newbie Thursday. ... i think i can forget about the Mod at Reddit :D	Okay lets begin, My Name is Alen Bisanovic. At the age of 6 Years i moved from Bosnia to Austria and began a new life. I am right now on the High Technology School in the Department of IT. Besides study and playing soccer i love to play CSGO and look and write on the Reddits. I hope you like my small presentation:)	10-12 months	I think this Reddit is good for the guys at Valve they get bugs and ideas from here.
6/1/2015 14:07:25	http://www.reddit.com/user/cenTT/	GMT-3	23		I don't have any experience with CS:GO servers. But I have been admin of servers in CS:S which is really similar since it uses the same base engine. I had a few clan servers in CS:S that we used mainly to practice and make scrims. Some of them were also open to the public for casual play.		Awesome! It's great to see people helping new players every week to progress faster and enjoy the game in a better way.	Well, my name is Franc and I'm a 23 year old law student (graduating this semester) from Brazil. I love games in general and CS is by far my favorite FPS. I play it since 2000 when one of my cousins introduced me to the game.   I am a really chilled and patient person and have been an admin on a few internet forums before. I decided to apply for this mod opportunity because I'm really into Global Offensive and I'm always browsing /r/GlobalOffensive so I could definitely be helpful to the community.	13-18 months	The community is great, one of the best in reddit. I rarely see people disrespecting each other and there are always good discussions going on.   One thing that do bother me sometimes is the amount of videos/gifs without interesting content on the front page. Sometimes I think there could be another subreddit (/r/GlobalOffensiveVideos maybe) for videos in general.  I come to /r/GlobalOffensive mainly to see discussions, news about the pro scene and other interesting content, but most videos posted are of some funny play, something a streamer did or some montage.  But other than that, it's a great subreddit. The one I spend the most time browsing and I always recommend it to my CS:GO friends.
6/1/2015 14:12:16	http://reddit.com/user/montagic	GMT-7	18	Basic understanding of both HTML and CSS.	I was an admin of a jailbreak server called TRF that has since shut down. I have also moderated several good servers in the past.		I love helping people out who may have questions about the game. I think it's a fantastic idea as we a started as a newb and I know I would have certainly wanted someone more expetienced to have helped me out.	Well, I'm an 18 year old male ENFP who has been playing counterstrike since I was 10. I love people with a fiery passion and it makes me more than happy to assist people. I am very active on reddit and have been a redditor for three years now and have been a moderator/active community member of other forums. 	10-12 months	I love this subreddit. Although I've become last active over the following months, I believe it is currently being handled with quality in mind. The posts are gearing more towards media and less informational posts which I'd like to try and find a happy medium.
6/1/2015 14:32:36	http://www.reddit.com/user/nick027nd/	GMT-4	21	Bare bones HTML and LUA.	Yes, I'm a Council member in the "Games For Life" community which involves being familiar and administrating across all of our servers. I'm also one of the head moderators there that also deals with community affairs.	I think it's a great idea to get the everyone in the community involved and together!	I think it's a great way to help out newcomers and even experienced players a like!	I've always been the type of person to help and support communities. I've been involved in numerous leadership building programs, such as the Air Force Auxiliary and my local Police Academy where I was a supervisor as well as class leader.	7-9 months	I think it's a pretty powerful community overall. When something happens we all come together and support each other no matter the cause.
6/1/2015 15:04:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/AnselmoA/	UTC-4	18	No.	No.	Awesome idea, just needs more organization the last one had an acceptable error as the update happened but around 9:30 EST most of the time there is a fair delay.	It is a great thing to help out the newer players, I honestly wish I had that when I started.	Personally I am very passionate about Counter Strike, as it was introduced to me in Winter 2013 and I haven't stopped playing since. I always enjoyed competitive games so Counter Strike is just something I now love so I would love to be involved in the community.  	4-6 months	The community is great, it is rare to see higher ranked players making fun of lower ranked players. They are all so helpful, even the mods give you a good laugh! Referring to the April fools joke!
6/1/2015 15:21:14	http://www.reddit.com/user/sukhi1/	GMT+0	17	No, coding is not something that I am particularly skilled at	I have not managed any CS:GO servers as I do not currently own the game (but I will soon enough). However around about a year ago I had been actively playing an unofficial 2D version of Counter Strike 1.6 called CounterStrike2D (CS2D). On that game which I had played for 3 years, I was the admin of a mod server with 2 other admins for 1 year and I was the mod for other servers due to the contacts I made in the server.   On the server, we had an established clan that had two parts. The first part was on the fun server that I had admin rights to, and the other half was the competitive team we had created to go against other clans in the game which I was part of.  Let me know If you want to know more about the server I admined and about CS2D. 	I think that I is a great idea for new players and experienced players to come together to play and this is something I have always looked forward to being part of when I purchase the game after my exam period.	I think that it is an easy way to get your answers out for things that you don't know to well about the game and being able to get friendly answers as forums aren't moderated properly. This is something I love to browse as  there are questions in there that I haven't even thought about.	I am currently an A-Level student in the UK that is about to finish the first year (3 days from now) so I'm just about to get into the swing of things after that and with University applications that need to be done in about 6 months time, I think there will be no better time to be part of a community that I am passionate about.  I have never played Global Offensive before so I will be learning with newer members of this sub which I fell as though it is better for me and them as we will be on the same level as them.  As I mentioned before, I have been part of CS2D and I have gained skills from there that I can use in CS:GO and this subreddit except for scripting and mapping which I could never get the hang of.  Thanks and please let me know if there was anything that I've missed out or of you need more details of anything mentioned.	0-3 months	I am quite new to this community, so I don't have anything critical to say. However, I think that this will be good opportunity for me to be close to a subreddit and watch it grow and watch the community grow while I help to keep the subreddit on check with the team.
6/1/2015 15:42:31	http://www.reddit.com/user/soppamies01/	GMT+2	26	None	I was a founder for an RP community called www.nerdsrpg.com and also used to do admin work there. They had a pretty active playerbase playing mostly ArmA3 with 60+ players at all times on the server. Being part of that community for 6 months and being admin there thought me a lot in handling admin work ie. making sure rules were being followed in the forums, in the game servers and in Teamspeak. Though I left this community not a long ago due to losing interest in ArmA3 generally and it taking way too much my time from my company	Played there a few times. I really enjoyed them and they were organized really well.	No thoughts	I'm a pretty relaxed guy. Been playing games as long as I remember. Built my first computer when I was around 10. Started to play CS around 02 and stopped around 08-09 (never played Source). Picked up GO last August and been hooked ever since. I really enjoy watching eSports of course CS but also Dota 2 and LoL.  I own a small company and most of my days are spent at a computer so I like to keep up-to-date to what is going on in the world so I think I'm pretty book smart so to say. Also having your own company gives you a pretty laid back working hours :D	7-9 months	They can be brutally honest and if you are sensitive it can be pretty overwhelming. I myself enjoy reading through all the heated conversations and debates what users usually have on different matters.  I feel like people have calmed down towards the pro players and the critique pointed at them. Rewind 3-4 months back and people were having these witch hunts for pro players and it was getting quite out of hand and back then I really didn't like the atmosphere of /r/GlobalOffensive. Though it is starting to look like a theme here that there will always be someone or something the whole or most of /r/GlobalOffensive has hatred towards.
6/1/2015 15:53:26	http://www.reddit.com/user/dotcom461/	GMT+0	14	I have a good understanding of coding, created various software for myself and helped others with their coding. The languages I frequent are:  CSS C# Python PHP HTML XML	Ive hosted a few servers for Minecraft and Garrys Mod for small amounts of players (< 20 players). I kept players inline in the rules and held mini games and events at weekends.			I love Counterstrike, I play it everyday, and have reached 1000+ hours.  Anything source I love, and creating maps for the source engine is one of my hobbies.	4-6 months	
6/1/2015 15:59:47	https://www.reddit.com/user/itsIzumi/	GMT-4	14			I've never participated in a community night due to my headset's microphone being pretty bad and having more background noise than somebody in the middle of a tsunami. I think it's great for any mapmakers who want their map to gain some attention.	This is being edited in after the fact because I didn't put anything here.  I like the concept of Newbie Thursday, the only issue with these types of posts is the fact not every new player is going to wait until Thursday to ask a question. I'd prefer a single post that stays up for an entire week.  Though /u/GlobalOffensiveBot is a cutie ;)	So first off, I know you guys are probably looking for Europeans due to the fact it's difficult to cover time zones with so many North Americans. If that's a breaking point I completely understand.   So a bit of general things about me: I am an Anglophone ninth grade student living in Quebec. I enjoy writing things and doing petty work other people don't want to do because I don't have much else going on.    I started playing CS:GO and following its competitive scene after watching "SPELA MODIGT // PLAY BRAVELY - Fnatic and Devilwalk at Dreamhack Winter 2013",as I already had the game from buying the Valve Complete Pack, I just laid off of downloading it because I was new to PC gaming and had a garbage computer. CS:GO is now technically my most played game at 1,095 hours (though I do have approximately 8,636 Stanley Parable idle hours, I can't remember why I started doing so).   I've gone back and watched VODs of early CS:GO and 1.6 matches to try to understand some context of players and consider my knowledge of the competitive scene above average.  Now I'm going to go over the things you are and aren't looking for.   "Looking for people who are: active, patient, helpful, and kind."  I definitely am active. My Reddit lurking schedule is anywhere from 2 PM to 2 AM (GMT-4 timezone) during a weekday and that'll only be extended as my summer break starts in three weeks. I definitely think I am helpful as I try to always help people who post "New player here, can you explain X to me" if I think I can provide a sufficient answer. In general I am quite patient and quite easy to work with. "Kind" is a debatable topic that I'm probably biased on, but I'm serviceable for sure.  "Looking for people who are: mature, regardless of age."  I'd like to think so.   "Looking for people who are: attentive to detail."  Mildly attentive, I'm sure you would need a minimum of four hands to count the other applicants more attentive than I am.   "Looking for people who are: fluent in English and/or can speak their mind in an appropriate, comprehensive manner (in English)."  This is my forte. While I will obviously make the occasional mistake here and there, I consider myself good at grammar and good at expressing myself, especially in text form. I will admit I do write out "I'd've" sometimes, which is grammatically incorrect, but it feels so right.   "Looking for people who are: frequent commenters and/or experienced Redditors."  Definitely a frequent commenter on /r/GlobalOffensive, just to showcase this, I have earned 3097 comment karma in /r/GlobalOffensive and 249 in /r/pcmasterrace, which is my second highest karma earned in one sub. As for experienced Redditor, I have no doubt that I have a lot to learn, but I'm willing to apply myself and learn.   "Looking for people who are: often online and typically available."  As mentioned before I can be on for roughly 12 hours a day. Next week will probably be a bit less because the writing portion of my French exam starts then and I'm quite sub-par at French, but I should still be typically available.  "Not looking for people who are: egotistical"  I'm supposed to talk about myself in this application so I don't think this counts as being egotistical, but this is by far the most I've talked about myself online since I don't even use social media sites like Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/et cetera. I'll leave you guys to decide this one, though.  "Not looking for people who are: known trolls."  I don't think I'm known for anything. Hell, I don't think anybody has ever tagged me with RES.  "Not looking for people who are: frequent violators of the rules." "Not looking for people who are: strictly low-effort posters."  Grouping these two up together because they're not mutually exclusive. To my knowledge I've never broken the rules of any subreddit or Reddit itself and I do put effort into comments, with the obvious exception here and there.   "Not looking for people who are: power-moderators looking for another sub to add to their list."  I do not moderate any subs and have not had a chance to be corrupted yet.  "Not looking for people who are: in a position to potentially have a conflict of interest."  I'm not a community figure nor do I have any connections with anybody who would want me to abuse my potential position. I only know the Reddit names of two of my friends on Steam for that matter, so I'm kind of a lone(ly) wolf ;~;   With all that said, I'll continue to be an active commenter and user of /r/GlobalOffensive regardless of how this application turns out.	10-12 months	Before I begin: /r/GlobalOffensive has been by far my most actively visited sub since ESL One Cologne 2014, having over twelve times the amount of comment karma earned from it than my second highest sub. So I've seen a decent amount of shenanigans.  The community seems to have  general consensuses that change whenever anything noteworthy happens. In case you're wondering, that's my way of saying there's a lot of circlejerks. I don't mind these unless it involves hating on somebody, but of course if it's overdone for an extended period of time it gets annoying (see: "literally unplayable" and any variant)  One of my most memorable moments on /r/GlobalOffensive was that update thread that got spammed with ":(" due to being disappointing and had to be given chemotherapy by the mods.   Basically I think /r/GlobalOffensive's community is like HLTV's community, except with a higher level of English and no country flags for people to argue over.

I love to play and watch counter strike and I love to teach people about it and how to play better. I am studying Computing at GCSE and predicted an A grade. I will be continuing studying Computing at A level next year. My dream is to bring the UK scene into the major league scene and compete at pro level with my team.  xoxo	2-3 years	fun mostly non toxic people 
6/1/2015 16:07:01	http://www.reddit.com/user/JaysonMW	UTC+5	14	This is in interesting question, but my only experience is Lua for Garry's mod and minute amounts of HTML.	I have a ton of experience moderating Garry's mod servers, and don't play enough community to mod on a CS server.   My past experience on Garry's mod was an Admin role, and multiple Moderator roles. I Admin'd for a few years on a now-dead server that was hosted by NFOservers and had a community around a thousand man strong. When that server finally kicked the bucket due to lack of funding, I was offered a position by a member to moderate his server, which I accepted until it also died to low funding.		I enjoy browsing Newbie Thursday, Especially since only a few months ago I was just that, a noob at CS.	I've been playing CS or about 3 years now, loving the game since I picked it up. I'm a football player in a small town in Tennessee, and a sophmore as of this school year. I've lived all over the country, and have moved a ton. I love video games, and love playing football. My favorite subject by far is science, and my favorite game is, you guessed it, CS.	4-6 months	I love the community, although we have a bit of a witch hunting problem sometimes, whether it be towards CS:GO developers or pro players.  The community is lovely at times, but can also be toxic on any given day.   In general, I love the community and wish I ran into more players in my CS  Gameplay.
6/1/2015 16:09:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/Expandedcelt/	GMT-5	23	I am afraid I do not have much experience in coding beyond the most basic HTML experience from things like Craigslist ads etc.	Nope. Damn, I'm feeling less and less qualified as I go through this.		When I was first getting started, newbie thursday helped a lot and as I get more experienced I would also like to start contributing eventually.	So here's where I shine compared to other users. I am SHOCKINGLY available and active on Reddit. I am currently employed, but only work about 12 hours a week and literally all my time not working or sleeping is spent with csgo on one monitor, and /r/globaloffensive on the other monitor. I am mature, confident, well spoken, humble, and friendly, and would absolutely love to contribute to the community that has given me so much help and enjoyment.  I think it should be pretty clear from my profile that I'm on Reddit a ton, and while I've only recently started posting on /r/globaloffensive regularly, I've been lurking for a while. I am clearly not a troll, as I only have much negative karma on 3 subreddits for comments that weren't popular, /r/politics for posting in favor of Gary Johnson during the 2012 elections, /r/Bodybuilding for saying I had a lower body fat percent than they believed (not entirely sure why I got -12 karma for that) and /r/dogshowerthoughts for posting something that wasn't "Woof woof woof" I'm not looking to be a powermod, and you can hold me to that. I was a mod on /r/circlejerk for a couple of months back in 2013 when they added everyone to their mod list on April Fools day that asked, but I did nothing with the privilege and haven't been a mod anywhere since. I am online from about 1 pm EST to 3 am EST pretty much daily which means you will have good coverage from an active user through peak hours across multiple time zones.  Regarding personality, I'm a friendly, easygoing guy who used to work as a social media manager for a dental office, meaning I have experience in PR and can easily represent the mod team if ever an unpopular decision is made and sway public opinion in our favor rather easily, and make regular posts that help keep users faith in us while remaining open and honest with our base.  I hope my lack of programming experience and server experience doesn't get in the way an you are willing to let me become a new member of the community interaction team, and even if not, I look forward to hopefully continuing to interact with all of you on the subreddit!	4-6 months	I think the GlobalOffensive community is definitely good with a bit of room for improvement.  There seems to be a lot of what users complain about as 'shitposting' which may be improved upon, as well as a lot of whining about 'shitposting' which is equally unnecesary and irritating, though I am honestly on the fence as to whether or not it's the mod team's job to remedy that. It could be argued that subreddits like /r/askhistorians that have incredibly strict mod rules are higher quality, but at the same time are a lot less fun as well, and I think there can be a happy middle ground.
6/1/2015 16:22:00	http://www.reddit.com/user/Swampyl/	GMT-4	16	Some experience with HTML and willing to learn whatever may be necessary				I'm Josh from Connecticut. I've been an active member of the gaming community for years. I've been playing games competitively for almost as long having experience with competitive CoD (sue me), Starcraft 2, Smash Bros. Melee (even hosting a couple of my own tournaments and running them smoothly as a TO), and just recently dabbling in CS:GO. I'm confident in saying I'm mature for my age and take criticism well.	0-3 months	I think it's a solid subreddit, especially given its size. I've seen subs go toxic with smaller numbers.
6/1/2015 16:33:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/BjarneBanane187/	GMT+2	18	No experience.	No experience.	I think that Community Night is an amazing event. It gives subreddit users the chance to play with friends and other users and also gives map-makers a chance to get a lot of constructive criticism.	I can personally say that Newbie Thursday is a great help for newer players. When i started playing CS:GO about half a year ago i was a terrible player (placed silver 1). I started reading the Newbie Thursday Threads and really taking the advice to heart. Lots of practice and with the help of a "teacher" I found in one of the threads I am now Master Guardian 2 :) So i can personally say that they helped me as a beginner and I think a lot of others aswell.	Allright, my name is Bjarne and I am 18 years old. I live in Germany and at this moment i am in a transitioning period as i have quit the university i was attending until late march. I am in the process of deciding what i want to do next and don't have any other responsibilities i have to attend to.  I discovered CS:GO and the /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit about half a year ago through esports. I was watching NiP vs. Fnatic in a final and was completely hyped and pumped up for the game, a feeling which i never really experienced watching League of Legends. So i decided to give the game a shot and really liked it ! What intrigued me even more than playing myself though, was watching competetive esports games. I think that Counter Strike is by far the best esport to watch for people who know the game and people who don't.  About 2-3 months back (around IEM Katowice) i was watching the final of NiP and fnatic. After the game, which left me in shambles because it was so incredibly close and suspenseful i was casually browsing the subreddit when i stumbled upon this thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2z4ofz/fnatic_vs_ninjas_in_pyjamas_esl_one_katowice_2015/ (since been deleted) by ajsadler, whom i immediatly recognized as "that guy that does post-match threads !". In this post AJ was asking for people who wanted to help out making post-match Threads and as I had nothing to do i sent him a message. Now I'm part of a 5 man team that does the Post-Match Discussion Threads for the subreddit.   A while back me and a friend of mine who is also on the team (/u/Soekarnoo) saw a post from the mods asking for help writing the new wiki and we decided to both sign up to help with the esports section of the wiki.   So i guess the point I am trying to make is that I already am a fairly active member of this community and would like to become an even bigger contributor. I really like the subreddit and it's community and would like to help even more !  Cheers and best regards !  - Bjarne	0-3 months	I think that the /r/GlobalOffensive community is awesome ! As someone who has played League of Legends for 5 years now and was on the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit the whole time I can say that the /r/GlobalOffensive community is much better and more positive. The people in the sub are extremely helpful and always ready to help each other out or give tips, I think this relies on the fact that Counter Strike puts much more emphasis on individual performance.  As for the content of the subreddit, I think it's fine but could be better. I personally don't really enjoy a lot of "Fluff" posts or what some people might call "shitposts", but I can see why a lot of people find them funny and think they're fine as long as they aren't the most dominant sort of posts.   Another thing that i have even discussed with mods previously is the spoiler policy of /r/GlobalOffensive. I think the subreddit needs to have some clearer spoiler policies, like for example in the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit.
6/1/2015 17:01:59	http://www.reddit.com/user/bobloblawloblawbomb/	UTC-5	28	No	Adminned a private 1.6 server several years ago used for team scrimmaging, basic server maintenance	Awesome. Team Liquid has a community night as well that I play in sometimes. Surprised reddit doesn't have one as well (or I'm not aware of one). I think it would be a great way to bring players together as long as basic etiquette rules are followed. TL does a great job with their ruleset.. all skill levels allowed and welcome, be friendly, don't be a dick, globals welcome too but remember it's a friendly game night first and foremost... 	An important link between ranks. Another great way for the community to grow together and connect.   The thread is also a good way to promote other csgo-related subreddits and information in a weekly, centralized thread. 	I'm 28 and first played CS in middle school on my youth group leader's computer. One round during that first pub session, I was in a 1v3 with an awp... I noscoped 2 people (didn't know how to scope) and then died after the last guy rushed me with an mp5. That was CS 1.3. Played 1.6 competitively into CAL-M and then quit for a while during college. Went to medical school and currently an intern in pathology. Because of my occupation I don't have the most time but I would like to contribute as much as I can. I can honestly say I am on r/GO constantly.   CSGO is my favorite hobby. I was proud of being in CAL-M before, but the more I play the more I realize there is for me to learn. After the recent ban waves, I hit SMFC for the first time. I'm at a point where I can kind of see the summit. It's been an exhilarating climb that I want to share with other people as long as they are willing to learn and I think this subreddit is doing a great job of curating a forum for a community experiencing explosive growth. I'd like to help out however I can.	19-24 months	I am honestly very happy with the content and have no problem with how it has evolved over the years. I followed starcraft for the first two expansions and did not like how gameplay-related content became more and more uncommon as the subreddit grew, replaced by endless memes. r/GO has avoided this. The content is quite balanced in my opinion.   There are a few things I would like to see more in the sidebar. Definitely a section listing current and upcoming tournaments and leagues. Possibly a section listing "featured" streamers or youtube channels, to include learning channels and/or selected popular streamers.    
6/1/2015 17:17:56	http://www.reddit.com/user/Henrikbiscuit/	GMT+2	17	I've worked a bit in HTML/CSS, and had a couple of basic courses. So I am kind of familiar with it, but not in anyway pro.	I actually am hosting a server at the moment. A while ago, someone posted something about go-free.info which is a place where you can host a free server. You get no money for it, but it is great experience! It's one of the more popular servers, that they host, with very regular visitors. Here is the server site: http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/37.187.142.159:20615/  	I have sadly not had much experience with them, but I was part of a community, that also hosted game nights. I though it was one of the most fun experiences, and loved all the crazy ideas and gamemodes. One I found particularly fun, was a Wild West themed match. Where one person used duallies, another used Nova, and I think the last person used deagle (You were divided in teams of 3 people).	I'm not quite sure what it is, but if it's giving tips and tricks to newcomers of CS:GO I love it. I remember the struggle of being a silver, and fighting my way up to LEM. It was a hard journey, and I wouldn't have got there without my friends. Newbs need to get a push, and I would gladly help!	Well, my name is Henrik, and I live in Denmark. My hobbies are CS:GO and Pokémon. I have all together spend about 2000 hours in CS:GO. I am also a fan of professional CS:GO, and have watched countless of pro matches. Right now, my almost full time occupation, is my boarding school, but I still use a lot of my time on /r/globaloffensive! Almost all of my friends play CS:GO, and I have converted almost all of those who don't (Even made one buy a desktop, just to play CS:GO better). In school I get pretty good grades in both English and Mathematics, but not so much in Danish. I was hooked the first time I played CS, which was a while back, and loved all it's mini games. Today I am much more of a competitive player, but I still enjoy some surf now and then. I have never cheated, but I still got a VAC ban for using a FOV changer in MW2 (Looks bad on my profile). I hope you choose me, because I will do my best to make /r/globaloffensive a better place!	10-12 months	Well, before KQLY got banned, people didn't really focus on hackers. There was a lot more of edits, and user created content! But I still think that the community is a wonderful place, that really seems eager to make CS:GO a better game, and I really love that!
6/1/2015 17:25:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/Monso/	GMT-5	27	I'm a 7th-prestige Source Engine Console scripter.	Yes; my own local listen server.  I am the only player on it all the time.	S'alright.	S'good.	This is just a test to see how the timezone is supposed to be entered.	5+ years	S'cool.
6/1/2015 17:31:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/TEOTT/	GMT+1	18	A little bit of HTMAL and Java	no	It sounds like a good idea but i didn't have any chance to participate because i had to concentrate on school	It is alway a good thing if you learn new stuff even if you think you already know much about the game. It gives everyone new insight of the game and helps developing the community	I am a Death Metal loving guy who just finished school and loves CS:GO and loved to play League of Legends and found CS as an distraction from frustrating League. I am not good at this game but i enjoy it and even with the black sheep(cheaters, smurfs, etc.) i still like it	0-3 months	I think it is a very nice and honest community(exept the usual outliers) and i think it is one of reddits nicest communities overall(way better than /r/leagueoflegends for example)
6/1/2015 17:41:14	http://reddit.com/u/x9a	UTC-5	17	Objective-c, Java, python,  new to HTML & CSS.  Im no master at programming, but I can get most stuff done.	Runescape servers 3 or so years ago (Yes, feel free to laugh)	I like them, think theyre good for the community.	Awesome! I think every new player should have a place to ask questions. Peoples biggest fear is being criticized and having those threads save them from that fear.	Im from Toronto, I like programming and video games. Im a full time student and i work Tuesdays and Thursdays. I spend about 40 hours per week on this game, trading or in MM. Outside of the internet I like BMX'ing, Hockey, parties and working out. Im a really patient and relaxed person, I like helping out new people and being tidy and clean. I spend a lot of time helping others, so I think im good at it.	19-24 months	Its hit and miss, sometimes I really like it, but other times its stale.  I think improvements can be made, but things are  great the way they are atm.
6/1/2015 18:14:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/ytzy	GMT+1	27	nope	Just normal cs:go servers with the rcon commands  or plugins 	seems fun  but never joined 	not interested at all 	i am 27  from germany  but live in france since 2 years , i dont realy look to be a mod but  many times  when i surf on reddit and i see spamm i think , woah one click and i could  delete  that scammer link . to be honest i think my english might be my biggest problem depending on what your looking for 	2-3 years	that its more of a casual  comminuty then hardcore gamers , and i think that they are not realy  poeple that care about  gameplay  more about fun stuff and skins  , bets  and  casual stuff ... my guess would be  that most of the poeple are >DMG  and playing since under 10 months ^^
6/1/2015 18:16:03	http://www.reddit.com/user/AssPancakes98/	GMT+3	17	NO I do not, I have take computer science courses but I do not intend to touch any of the code.	I have not hosted a counter strike server, but I have owned and admined multiple minecraft servers. So I do know how to deal with most issues that will arise.	I have not tried community night. Although I really want to one of these times.	Great! It helped me a lot and I think it is a awesome collaboration of people coming together to help lower ranks!	I am Jacob, I am a 17 year old guy from Canada. I am still in high school but I have a love for counter strike. I try my best to be nice and help people out if I can because I take enjoyment in helping people out!    I am a big supporter of the professional scene, and that is not from the betting standpoint. I love watching the nail biting moments and the amazing shots they pull out almost every time and the fact that I can see that people are able to make a living off playing video games is truly amazing.    I hope you guys choose me as mod! Have a great day!	7-9 months	I think there should not be that dark shadow of underage betting hovering over the professional scene. Although I love the funny trick shots and moments, I think it is a great place to come to wind down.   I think people should be welcomed a bit more to express their opinions because when I see someone do it, they get down voted to china and back.
6/1/2015 18:53:31	http://reddit.com/u/v11che	UTC+0	25	Software engineer with 3 years experience and a first class masters in Comp Sci	Ran a 9 man tf2 team for 2 seasons and played for kritzkast for 4 years, Admined a number of Css servers.	One night a  week where we can open a server and put on some organised games would be nice. I don't really have any ideas about it right now, but I'm happy to help out and play cs differently.	Happy to help out and teach people how to play the game.	Used to be a Tf2 player, now basically only play cs and when that stresses me out, I play anno 2070.  I'm from Liverpool, UK and I work as an automation enginner. I make robots do science. I fly about europe quite a bit, spending times in hotels, but luckily, my work laptop easily runs csgo ;)  I'm pretty genuine and I have a pretty strict code of honour. I'm lenient to people but I've been known to cut people who are morons out of my life.  I can't promise to be able to spell correctly, but I have a pretty good eye for a spell checker ;)  I suppose my play time isn't as much as it could be in csgo to apply for this position, but what I lack in play time I make up for in watching videos and streams etc. I take that fairly seriously, sa that's what helped me improve.  I always attend summer LANs in the UK (insomnia) so I'll be about if anyone wants a chat.  feel free to get in touch with me on skype if you want. My skype address is : v11che.  My steam is also v11che.  You said I could ramble, you fools!   Fin.    	2-3 years	I think it would benefit from more publicity about sub-subreddits. For example, subreddits that talk about tactics only and ones dedicated to trading, tournament streams etc.
6/1/2015 19:09:11	http://www.reddit.com/user/ezinc	GMT-7	19	C++, Java, HTML, CSS	I was admin of my own Minecraft and Garry's Mod server (it was quite a while ago, so don't judge me :P) to 10-15 or so concurrent players on each server. Dealing with griefers was a laborious experience, and it was certainly a real learning experience to avoid being either heavyhanded or too lenient with players. As for CS:GO, I have not been admin to a CS:GO server as much of my time is spent on either matchmaking, client, or private 10-man servers.	I have yet to participate in community nights. I would love to join, but a lot of time I am not aware there even is a community night! Perhaps if there was a set schedule with dates of upcoming community nights that was easily accessible from the front page of /r/GlobalOffensive, I would notice the dates more easily. 	The concept is great. It consolidates all of the self-posts that often flood /r/new. Not much to say about it. Somehow, pretty much all of the questions get answered. Even the ones at the bottom! I am now wondering if it is the mods that are answering all the questions, or if it is solely the community's doing.	League of Legends used to be my jam, and I was hovering around high Diamond I playing with a few pros before I eventually quit and moved on to CS:GO. I played a little of CS:CZ and CS:S zombies back when I was little, so the transition wasn't that hard. I am now LEM in CS:GO.   I used to be obsessed with cinematography, special effects, and visual media in general. I gave all that up and am now studying Computer Science (Games) at the University of Southern California. I finished my freshman year, so I am technically a sophomore now. I make a few games now and then with Unity and UE4. The biggest project I have worked on is "Elementerra" which used the Oculus Rift.  Currently, I am only taking one summer class so I have a lot of free time! To take advantage of that free time, I am currently making a CS:GO map for the current mapping competition. Since I live near a movie backlot and have worked in there a few times, I'll be using that a reference to set the theme for the map. It's already looking pretty sick with stage buildings and a bluescreen water tank.   I like to help people on /r/GlobalOffensive, whether it is about technical difficulties or tips on how to rank up. Most of the time, I remain neutral and try not to antagonize anyone. Occasionally, I do get a bit pushy with my opinions or sound sarcastic when I really am being sincere. The most recent examples I can think of are when I suggested that a user try out Call of Duty and when I voiced my opinion that the new operation missions should be played for fun instead of min-maxing drops/rank. The former was misinterpreted as an insult (he wanted certain movement/recoil changes and your weapon to be stowed when defusing, which CoD has) when I thought it was a legitimate solution, and the latter was just me being stubborn, although I accepted his opinion as a valid one. I don't resort to name-calling when engaging in conversation on this subreddit.  Thank you for reading all this, and have a good day!	10-12 months	I started browsing this subreddit about a year ago, so I only really have that time frame to compare things to. I have seen the general attitude shift from that of a smaller community (I remember a lot of self posts like "hi, I came from League of Legends and I want to learn CS") to a larger one with original content in the form of YouTube videos, comics, etc. Complaint posts have grown in frequency.   A lot of people complain that there is too much "fluff" nowadays with joke videos or posts. Prominent pro matches (most recent example being VP vs Kinguin) are still posted and upvoted to the front page, so that is not an issue. Honestly, the emphasis on "fluff" content being upvoted more is just because there are a lot more people browsing the subreddit now. Fast and funny things are more appealing to the masses. We can already see this with people preferring to upvote a gif of a play instead of a video of the exact same play since gifs take less time to load and do not have sound.   Sometimes I would like to see longer videos such as those done by voo, WarOwl, or RobDeeFul (CS:GO as a 1.6 Veteran) on the front page but since videos are already difficult enough to gain traction, I don't see it happening.  I never really had any complaints about the /r/GlobalOffensive mods. I haven't noticed any mod abuse nor has that been a topic in my time browsing the subreddit.   I think the /r/GlobalOffensive community contributed to the growth of the game itself to some extent. Ever since I started browsing this subreddit, I felt like I was more interconnected with the game and its users. It also helps that Valve often pays attention and even implements small things like spectator-mode flashbang icons straight from the reddit thread. Once, I posted a stupid little video of pashabiceps playing with his pecs. Within a few days the video gained 260,000 views. That's the power of this subreddit and its users. It has the ability to disperse game-related info very quickly. Without this subreddit, I wouldn't know half the things I know about this game.
6/1/2015 19:10:36	http://www.reddit.com/user/IKJudo/	GMT-7	23	I did a bit of coding on the websites that I administrated for. Basics HTML and PHP for the most part.	No server admin experience, but I did run websites!	I think it's a great way to get players together and remember that it's just a game, and not always a life or death situation.	A WONDERFUL way to explain certain aspects of the game to newer players and help them improve.	Hi!   My name is Zach, and I'm a 23 year old gamer. I live with my girlfriend (Gillian), Gillian's sister, (Lexi), and Lexi's fiance, Tony in a house in Clayton, CA.   I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember, thanks to my older brother. I've always loved being an active member of the communities for the games I enjoy the most.  CS 1.6/CZ/S/GO have been huge parts of my life and I've played the CS series longer than any other franchise aside from WoW. I love the game, and can't get enough!  I've launched and ran (quite successfully) two websites.  Community Manager and Head Administrator of The Halo Council. One of the most popular and thriving Halo communities during it's time. And Cloth5, a League of Legends eSports media website. I left shortly after the launch of C5 though, as the team I was working with all went MIA on me and I had no choice but to step down!  At home and offline I worked mostly as a server/manager of local restaurants, and attribute the majority of my customer service and exceptional interpersonal skills to that field.  I'm a friendly, outgoing and dedicated individual who would love to be a part of the mod team here, and I feel I would be able to bring a number of skills to the table to help everyone out.  Thanks for the consideration! - Zach	4-6 months	I have been a long time lurker and only recently started posting (although not a whole lot), but I think the community has come a long way. I do remember periods of extensive negativity and anger towards the devs and pro player witch hunts, etc. It's a lot more positive now. Nice plays are congratulated, and people with questions looking to improved are not overlooked. I think the community is in a great place right now.
6/1/2015 19:13:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/AirforceSF/	UTC-4:00	29	Basic knowledge of CSS and HTML. 	I do not have experience here. 	A community night would be a great way to bring something to look forward to. It would give the people a chance to talk to more like minded individuals and could even create friendships that were not discovered yet, and bringing the community together is one of the best things you can truly do.	Newbie thursday is a wonderful way to offer help in many forms. Even from a new player to an even newer player, just the feeling you get when you know you have helped someone and that person could one day help another would truly be a great experience. 	I am currently a mod on another sub reddit with about 6k users, so it's not much but I often am praised as one of the most fair and personable mods they have ever spoken to. I believe that is because I am in Law Enforcement so I have gained a lot of knowledge when it comes to disolving problems and how to talk and engage people. I truly love CSGO and I would do the best I can to make anything possible. I really put my heart and soul into everything I do and to be a part of this sub would be another amazing thing in my life. I thank you for your time. 	0-3 months	I have not been a part of the /r/GO community for a while, but I have been a part of the CS community for a long time now. It has its moments of doubt when it comes to the people you may run into. However, that being said, it truly is the BEST esports community you will ever find. The memories made in this community have been some of my more fond memories in the video game world. 
6/1/2015 19:15:55	https://www.reddit.com/user/ayy-bee/	GMT-5	16	Only experience with any sort of programming is Java, and it was very minor knowledge gained through public education, so I wouldn't read into it too muhc.	Yes, I am currently a volunteer pug moderator/kick dispute review/support person with CEVO. There would be no conflict of interest in any way as I'm in no way biased towards them, just trying to help the community is all. I was also an admin on many Source servers back in the day, but the past is too distant and I can't recall most of the names.	It is interesting, but the only times I have played in it it was taken way to seriously by most of the players, and it ruined the fun aspect as there was raging and arguments flying everywhere.	A good thing for the subreddit, experienced players can go and help any of the new players and newcomers to the subreddit with any problems they are having.	I'm Brendan O'Hare, I live in Houston, Texas, and I am currently a CEVO Support member and help out over there, and have been for about 2 weeks now. I've been a member of this subreddit for quite a while, but this reddit account is new as I resolved a dispute between me and a moderator over a few months ago. (formerly asdf_wrex/GOastro, can verify).   I've thrived on eSports all my life going back to Halo 2, to League of Legends, and to now, where my main focus is of course on Counter Strike. I played a bit of CS:S, but never anything serious, mainly surfing/bhopping (which I still do today), and have been taking this game competitively for a couple months, participating in ESEA pugs and the sorts. I've written for multiple eSports oriented sites and have what I believe to be a large amount of knowledge on the game.	19-24 months	I believe the quality of content has degraded over the past year or so, with most of the frontpage being filled with "PSA's" or complaints of bugs Valve has acknowledged in the past rather than gameplay discussions, or match threads.
6/1/2015 19:30:41	http://www.reddit.com/user/xt1nct/	GMT-5	28	I know some HTML. However, hopefully I will be starting my bachelors in Computer Science this September if all goes well, so that knowledge will expand.	I have not any experience hosting/admining CS:GO severs. I do have experience being an admin lead in one of the most popular Battlefield communities, Cmwgaming,com. I have written many documents for the group and we were able to expand from 4 severs to over 10 during transition from BF3 to BF4. The group is still doing quite well financially but I have lost interest in Battlefield series after the release of Hardline and the way EA treats consumers does not sit well with me.	I think it's a good idea. However, I was never a part of it myself. I kind of miss being a part of community. I would love to play with people better than me and learn from them. I also don't mind teaching those willing to learn.	I read those threads a few times. I think Newbie Thursday is great and I would be more than happy to contribute, especially since I'm LE now. Any events that get people involved and offer help are great because they allow the community to expand.	I dislike talking about myself but here it goes. I am 28 and engaged. I have worked various jobs and decided to go back to school at around 21-22. I used to be extremely active in all kinds of sports. When I was younger I played in Soldier of Fortune 2 CAL-invite ladder with XAT, my previous team won Cal-o. 3 years ago I had a severe reaction to a popular antibiotic with left with some nerve damage(which means pain/mild twitches) and tendon pain( it still might go away), which forced to be more competitive in gaming instead of sports because I can't really play any at a competitive level. I function pretty normally. I attend school full time and have a GPA of 3.75. I also love working on cars, I have a fully built Mazdaspeed 3, which will be getting a big turbo when I graduate, that should put me somewhere around 400whp. I actually went from knowing barely anything about the car to rebuilding the engine last summer. One of the best projects that I have done in my life and took nearly 5 months.  What else? I enjoy new experiences. I love learning new things. I'm open to new ideas. I don't mind my thought process or actions being questioned. I speak/write in Polish and English. I was brought up super religious but became an atheists. I do not wish to convert people in anyway. I'm pretty easy going. I really dislike any kind of admin/power abuse and will act against it.  If there is anything more feel free to ask. I would be more than happy to join and help the community.	4-6 months	I have not really posted much in /r/GlobalOffensive but I lurk all the time. For the most part people seem nice and always willing to help a newbie and provide a few tips.

6/1/2015 19:53:06	http://www.reddit.com/user/DaveDognaught/	GMT-7	14	I have some basic knowledge of HTML code, I have experimented in Python, and am starting to learn C++ in a couple of weeks.	Nope. But I have owned a server, and have had experience with server commands and whatnot. It was a public server running competitive when I felt like getting it up :P.	I love the idea of community nights. For a sub to come together outside of the sub and do anything together is great. It helps out many types of people, IMO mostly map-makers.	I feel like Newbie Thursdays are one of the best additions to this sub. I browse through the questions all the time and I am always happy to see how this affects the community in a positive away. However, not many new players even use Reddit, so we have a slight problem there, but otherwise it helps who it helps and should be a lasting sticky in this sub. In fact, if you head over to my profile, you will see that I transferred the idea to /r/paydaytheheist , the community there actually loved the idea and the mods seem to be working on something similar over there.	I have been a member of the CS community for some time. Maybe a year or more. I have been exposed to the game many times before, but never picked up on it before. Right now, I am almost at MG1 in ranked, a big achievement for me, having started at silver 3. I will be going into 9th grade next year, and to be honest, my life is a little meaningless and boring right now, having a grand total of three friends. I have decided that being a mod might bring some sort of purpose to my life, as I would be helping out the community little by little. Homework in the 8th grade was not that hard to do, and many friends from my HS German 1 class tell me that 9th grade is not too hard. I spend  lot of time on Reddit, and to help out the community would mean a lot to me, even if it means scrolling through all the 0- Up vote rule breaking posts to flag them down. All I want is to help out this amazing community that you guys created and to be the silent guardian of this sub. One of the hero's that /r/GlobalOffensive deserves right now, and a hero that /r/GlobalOffensive actually kind of needs right now. Peace.	4-6 months	The /r/GlobalOffensive community is actually very nice and welcoming (my point being that the CS community is not known for being nice in-game :P). Truly, one of the best communities on Reddit out there! What I like most is the general attitude of the people on the sub. They usually don't go on the offensive (no pun intended) with their comments, they express their opinions in a thoughtful way. However, you guys know more about this than any of us, sense you remove all the nasty stuff out of threads. In any case, the community as redditors see it is very clean and kind.
6/1/2015 19:54:23	http://www.reddit.com/user/tman7779/	GMT-7	16	No, I do not.	Yes, I have been an admin for a Garry's mod TTT server. My responsibilities included checking logs of the sever, kicking or banning players for breaking the rules, and making sure everyone on the server had a good time.	I think that Community night is a great concept that brings together people of the community in a fun way. It can also help new players to the game feel a lot more comfortable playing with others and interacting in the community.	Newbie Thursday is great because it allows players new and old alike to ask questions that they might think are stupid in a supportive environment.	I love playing CS:GO and other FPS games in my free time, and I enjoy browsing the Global Offensive subreddit for all things relating to CS:GO. I have been with the community for some time now, and I just want to play a larger role in maintaining one of my favorite subreddits. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my application, and I hope you take me into consideration for a shot at a moderation position. Thank you :) 	4-6 months	I really enjoy the community in the Global Offensive subreddit because there is so much variety. There people who are artist and make new content, there is a competitive scene surrounding the game, and it is a place where new and experienced players can interact and talk a about a game I love. Sometimes the community can beat the dead horse *cough* tec-9 *cough* and be critical, but overall the community is one of the best I have seen on Reddit in my 3 years on the site.
6/1/2015 20:03:51	http://reddit.com/user/iDanoo	GMT+12	23	HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, PHP, C++. 	Yes! I used to run my own dedicated CSGO server on an old debian box. Installed and configured myself. Simple 128 tick community competitive server. However ended up stopping it due to the ongoing power costs of running a second server.	I think it would be fun, would be good to play with other people you see around the sub and definitely learn some new stuff.	Would be good to teach newer people some stuff and just have some fun that isn't completely serious.	I study almost fulltime towards my pilots licence, but i'm always sitting on the computer with reddit open in another tab or two. Also play at least a game a day on CSGO just to keep up with all the changes. I have around 2000 hours cumulative on several accounts. I don't play on my main account too much as I don't want to derank from eagle, however I use my MGE/DMG account most days. 	10-12 months	I think it's generally good. Compared to ESEA and HLTV, I think it's overly pretty good. You see the odd troll here or there, but so far the mods seem to be doing a good job of keeping it a well rounded sub. 
6/1/2015 20:08:52	http://reddit.com/u/radishderp	GMT-4	18	I have limited experience in HTML and Javascript, however I am a fast learner and am willing to learn further on my own time.	I have no previous experience admining servers.			I am an 18 year old girl from Canada. I am a Gold Nova 1 CSGO player and enjoy the game thoroughly, as well as tend to stay on top of new events and cases, as well as updates of the game. I play other video games as well, such as Killing Floor 2, and many other FPS games although those two games are the main ones I currently play. I have wanted to get into admining for a long time as I enjoy being at the head of a community and being involved, as in my personal life I spend a fair amount of time volunteering for the same sort of experience: being involved in a specific community. 	4-6 months	I think the r/GlobalOffensive community is a great community with a positive air. I find it a good environment without too many negative users, and find many of the posts as well as comments to be useful and constructive, as well as completely relevant. 
6/1/2015 20:31:23	http://reddit.com/u/Geesher	GMT-5	16	I am experienced in CSS3 and HTML5. I am currently learning Javascript/jQuery. Here is one of the websites i designed (i had to change the second image since the server couldn't load it) http://vageeshad.site88.net/website/website.html	Well, to be honest, i haven't been an admin on any CS:GO servers specifically but in the past, i have been an admin on some minecraft servers (VectronCraft, anyone?) Other than that, I haven't really pursued owning or becoming an admin on any server. This probably because I really have no true use in becoming an admin since the only game i really play is CS:GO and I don't play on too many community servers regularly (Other than a few 1v1 arena servers).	My thoughts on community nights... This is an odd one to answer seeing as I haven't really participated in any of them (I did watch a stream for one once though). So I guess my opinion is that they should get more exposure through various popular streams (RoomOnFire, Faceittv) in order to expand the user base a little more. That's really all to be honest, i feel like community nights have the potential to be much bigger and more fun and i love how you guys have map play-testing incorporated into the community nights as well, bravo!	This was the first sub-reddit i had ever really browsed daily, as well as being the reason i made a reddit account. Around the time i started i was around the silver 3 rank and i was hell-bent on improving (although i was playing on a crappy little macbook air at the time), so the whole newbie thursday (I swear it was on Tuesday back then, maybe it just has a better ring to it) was an exciting idea. The problem I had with it though, was the layout and how daunting it was, it really turned me off of it. From the threads i've seen as of late, it seems much improved thanks to the implementation of the wiki. On the actual post i think there should be a type of demo review send in thing, if you want to have your demo reviewed by a higher rank (LE+ maybe?). For example, i could be the reviewer for a day, they would in some kind of dropbox link with a specific file name format (i.e. Rank_Name_RedditName.demo). I think a feature like this could really help a lot. Also, back when i got my new computer and was trying to get to MG, what i did to motivate myself was change by sub-reddit flair to an mg symbol, kind of weird but seeing as i got to mg in 19~ straight wins along with the fact that i haven't been able to replicate that ever again makes me think that that flair change had something to do with it. Well, the point is that maybe there should be some kind of daily challenge system to get people motivated to get better at the game, maybe even with leaderboards where you can post your results :)	Well, born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, at age six i was moved across the great lakes into a small town known as Eden Prairie in a state called Minnesota. Alright i really don't think y'all really care too much on how i was raised, so i'll get to the real juicy details (the stuff you came for). I started Pc gaming around 6th-7th grade with tf2. At this point, i had a really awful pc that could barely play tf2 (i had to play on orange in dx7 mode and i still could only get 20 fps) nevertheless I played with my friends, i played because of my friends and this has remained true till this day. I play because i want to play with people i like,  not because i truly enjoy the game (except i do enjoy cs immensely). I feel like r/GlobalOffensive could be less of a community, more like a family.(more generic stuff about me is that my favorite music genre is indie rock(i also listen to various other rock sub-genres as well as hardcore hip-hop) , fave band is arctic monkey's, i love watching movies and good tv (GoT, BB, BCS, TD) Also, if you actually read this far, thanks for reading :D (Also, i am not going to be here for the month of June but if you dm me on reddit i will probably get it as long as i have internet access on my phone)	13-18 months	While the community has circle-jerk tendencies (its inevitable, honestly), for the most part, the vocal users are genuinely nice people (in contrast to the trolls of HLTV lol). That being said, i feel like there are a lot of lurkers on this sub (judging from subs to votes ratio) and there could be more measures taken to try and have a more group-like discussions (similar to tv show subs like game of thrones that have a discussion every new episode) that promote looking at others views, since some of the things i've seen on the subreddit is that people with unpopular views seem to get buried (not necessarily down-voted) in the comments. We should emphasize that down voting means that the comment/post doesn't contribute to the discussion, not that you don't agree with the comment/post. I'm also bringing this up because i saw a post a while ago that stated that r/GlobalOffensive had really high amount downvote to upvote ratio (something like that) and i think that if we try and make the sub more positive place, it could be a better place for good discussion. Also, I think i should clarify that i'm not against circle-jerk posts like DelayedArtisticGuppy (check my top voted comment lol) but i think they shouldn't eclipse actual on-topic discussion. 
6/1/2015 21:31:30	http://www.reddit.com/user/oSharpie_HD	GMT-7	18	I don't have much professional experience in coding thus far. However i have created a few twitch bots for various people for numerous reasons. Some wanted a point system for their streams others wanted automated commands. So as far as minor coding and scripting goes i have indeed had some very slim experience.	I have hosted a few Garry's Mod servers and at one point i was indeed an administrator on a CSGO surf community server.   A little bit about my GMOD servers, well i once hosted a network of about 4 servers that each ran a different set of scripts, I.E. mod. I ran this community for about 6 months when i was 16 and eventually sold the ownership to a friend of mine. One of the main reasons i ended up selling my ownership was to venture into uncharted territory. I wanted to see what other games had to offer such as CS.   Now i mentioned i had gained some experience with a CSGO surf administration team. Yes, i indeed was an administrator of a surf community. I sincerely enjoyed my time surfing and wanted to help give back to the community i dearly enjoyed hanging out at. So i decided i would give up a little of my time surfing to administrating their forums, making sure donations were handled properly and that the ingame experience was at the best possible level it could be for our members.  I eventually lost the time availability to help my community out and had to respectfully step down from my position.   However, do not be concerned this was in the past, i find myself with almost too much time on my hands nowadays with nothing to do but browse reddit, enjoy some lovely csgo competitive and gambling my life away on various jackpot sites.	I actually hadn't even heard of Community Night until recently.  After doing some research i found that it is something i might be interested in. They seem interested in laid back relaxed gaming. Which is completely and totally respectable. Thoughts on community night are positive!	I think Newbie Thursday is fantastic.  Its a great, genius way for some of the newer members of the global offensive subreddit that are maybe new to the game and are not fully aware of certain things within CS to come and get help and ask questions to hopefully improve themselves as a player.   Personally i think it would be great to have a say in this event because it would be very neat seeing certain players grow and get better at the game over time using the help that you've provided them.	Well, my real name is Brayden Sharp. I was born and raised on the west coast of the united states. I deeply enjoy long walks on the beach at around sunset.  I've been into FPS competitive gaming for around 5 years coming from a shallow call of duty background to where i am now and where i plan to stay  CS.  I've sort of mentioned this before but i will go over it more in depth. One of the main reasons i am spending the time to write up this form is to just help out the community and help it grow for the better. I truly have gained and learned a lot from the community and simply want to try my best to give my time back to the community and help them out in any way possible. Whether that be moderating the subreddit or giving much needed recommendations for future changed to the community or game. I am simply trying to help with my time here.	19-24 months	So what are my thoughts on the community?  Well to be completely honest i think like ANY community there is always the dark side and the light side.  There's always going to be toxicity within ANY community that you may come across. However i have found the great side of the globaloffensive community to be truly enlightening. I have learned a ton from the community and would like to give back with my time cleaning up the community where needed.  As far as the dark side of the community goes, i dont have much to say for, as i tend to drift away from that side as i find it to be not enjoyable. With this being said, i am willing to help with my time and duties to do what needs to be done to better the community.
6/1/2015 21:55:53	http://www.reddit.com/user/TheFlyingZombe/	UTC-7	16	I have som basic RobotC and C+ code.It's just basic stuff nothing that you could learn in a few days but I plan on learning more over the summer.	No I do not have any experience in doing admin work for any game servers.	Community is fun and implemented in a good way I have only participated in a few community nights like the 10 mans but I have not done so in a while. 	Newbie Thursday's are good threads since people can ask questions on how to get better or any misconceptions they have about the game in a safe place and don't have to be clogging up the subreddit withquestions.	I am a 16 year old living in California(the boring farming part not the big city) I am in high school and will be a junior next year. I have been playing Counter-Strike ever since my brother introuduced me to it with CSS. I have been playing semi-seriously since the beginning of this year and float around MG2-DMG.	10-12 months	I think the community now is good there are a healthy amount of all kinds of posts from thoughtful analyses to the good old fashioned shitpost. The community is growing at an extremely fast rate since last year during Dreamhack Summer and an increase of moderators is obviously due.
6/1/2015 21:56:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/gobdonuts	UTC-5	15	Yes, have been doing HTML, Javascript and PHP the past few years. Mostly HTML and JS.	Yes, I've owned a few servers throughout the years of playing CS. The first one was when I was playing CS:S. And a second one I bought a few months ago in intention to make a Smoke Training Server, with different maps. Other than that, I was admin on 2 CS:GO servers. 	I haven't actually tried it yet, but now that you mentioned it, I will probably go play with the other players on it. Definately a good idea! Nothing to say as of now. 	I actually have read the comments in a few of them before, I've learned some tricks on a few maps and ways to learn the recoil on weapons. Great idea going, definitely keep that going.	I think I am a very honest and kind person. I like to help and I like to see people happy. I think with me being a Moderator, I can help and make people happy. 15 years old may seem like a immature age, but I am very mature for my age. You see moderation, I see a key to helping all. Moderator is a very important role for a Reddit community. I would like to make /r/GlobalOffensive a better place for all. I code, do Photoshop and edit at a professional stage. I've made, and debugged a lot of websites. I love Reddit and will always continue to. Thank you for reading and have a splendorous day! ;)	7-9 months	A very good community all in all. All the people seem nice and looking to help. Though I have seen a few being rude to each other, but every community has some of those. That is a part of why I would like to help the Reddit community become even better. Make the rude people learn their mistakes, and last of all, make /r/GlobalOffensive a more cheerful and safe place to all. 
6/1/2015 22:02:35	http://www.reddit.com/user/HudsonHTH/	GMT-3	16	I am currently in a Computer Science class and have experience in basic java, and will be in another class that is more advanced next year.	Yes I have administered many servers, but not CSGO/Counter Strike ones. I used to play a lot of minecraft back in the day and would hold staff positions on many servers that had large communities. This also included forums just like the subreddit for CS:GO.			I am a sophomore in high school (about to finish school year, last week hype!). I play the saxophone in band and marching band which is pretty sweet. I love to play counter strike and other games such as Hearthstone, League of Legends, and Super Smash Bros. Melee. Thats about it! Hope you have a nice day.	10-12 months	I love the CS:GO community. I love the game and I love what people have to say about and what they think should be changed about the game or the forums/community.
6/1/2015 22:24:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/pitastrudl/	GMT+1	21		i have experience in linux servers, and i can learn it easily	they are great, but need some automatization or more administration	i dont participate in those 	i have my fair shair of moderating forums so i know that to be a good mod you need to understand the community and understand their point of view. following iron strong rules will only upset the community. 	13-18 months	to be honest, people are missing what is important and following everyone as a herd of sheep, which nobody can change. 
6/1/2015 22:53:59	http://www.reddit.com/user/Leowits/	GMT-4	16	Little experience in C, Javascript, html, and python 	no	I enjoy them, I wish they were larger	I feel it could be expanded 	I have been playing CS intermittently for 5 or so years, but competitively for about 6 months. I enjoy the game and the community thoroughly and would love to help serve it.	10-12 months	I feel like much of the community is very toxic, and this is not good, however I do see many being very helpful to each other. 
6/1/2015 22:56:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/HeyItsProgram/	GMT-7	15	No, sorry. I do have very little experience with HTML, only having retained the pure essence of the language.	Yes, I have been been an administrator (or moderator), on many different servers, across different games, however not any in CSGO. Although Minecraft servers, and hear me out, may not seem like the highest form of credibility, they do provide the Admin, or again Mod, with a hefty amount of complaints and problematic situations. Back when I was active in the Minecraft community two or so years ago, I moderated the Orecraft and Contritio servers. My amazing, outstanding, and completely fully developed 13 year old mind struggled with terms to come across me such as "biased", "unfair" and "retarted", constantly being flung by community members (who were surprisingly on the losing end of the situation at hand). I do think that I maintained myself well, and dealt with the problems in a manner that was either appropriate in regards to the server rules, or appropriate in relation to the context . After Minecraft I went on to moderate some Garry's Mod Deathrun servers, and now I'm here.	I see absolutely no problem with these. They are optional participation, they get people in the community together in-game, they aren't advertised to the point of annoyance. Overall a good idea.	I think that Newbie Thursday, as long as it is being applied in the fashion that it is currently, is well off. The track which it would have to follow to receive any negative feedback or connotation would be if it was something that is enforced. Newbie Thursday shouldn't turn into something that will cause a break in the community, like if one didn't get uploaded for two weeks in a row, the community might roll up into the fetal position and start a large commotion. "Where did it go? What did it do? Did someone die? It got hacked! (all exaggerations of course).	Well, I'm still in school, so that's a start. Otherwise I'm not fully invested into CSGO. I played it for about a year, and just stopped recently. I go on the CSGO subreddit almost everyday when I'm not busy, for 30 minutes at a time. I think that moderating is a fun thing to do, because you feel like you actually might be helping someone, being evolved from that point where you were the one asking for help. Other than that there isn't much else to say. I'm fun when I can be, and serious when I need to be, posting on reddit isn't something that I normally do, unless for giveaways and such. Usually I just look at posts and threads comments, and continue on my merry way. For once I kind of want to be involved in something that I feel is significant in some way. CSGO is  in no way my life, but I wouldn't mind making it a part of my life.	7-9 months	Well, first off, from a PERSONAL standpoint, its user friendly as hell. Not being someone who posts material or questions, I had to rely on the questions asked by others to get me familiar with CSGO. All of the threads with questions, especially the Newbie Thursday ones, everyone decided to be nice for some reason. Other than that, people are very opinionated. Generally, a full scale keyboard battle won't unfold in front of our very eyes, rather the discussion will end quickly, however sometimes it does escalate, but these things happen. I don't really notice the subreddit mods, which means they are probably doing their job correctly. The only time they came to my attention was during those massive thread deletions, but for the best I suppose.
6/1/2015 22:58:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaWolf101/	GMT-5	16	I took HTML and CSS classes, can't call myself an expert but I know more than nothing..haha	Was admin of a minecraft server for two years, I know that's a lot different from CSGO but it gave me experience. Server always had around 40 concurrent players, gave me experience in policing things in general and how to deal with rulebreakers. I mod other subreddits, including /r/TheOnion which I am head mod of. 	I love community night even though I haven't participated in a very long time. It's wonderful to get the community together for events. 	I think it's great, I'm very glad it started. I began the game as a Silver 1 and now I'm at MG2. When I posted help threads when I first joined the sub, I was often laughed at for being low even for a silver. I'm glad there's a thread where new players can ask questions and learn the game better in a safe space	Well, I'm 16, finishing up Sophomore year of high school. I live in North Carolina in the U.S. Been on Steam for a few years even though my current account is a little under two years old. I formed a 5 man team with my friends playing CSGO a full year ago. We were originally all Silvers but most of us got to Nova, with me reaching MG. I enjoy helping people a lot and I'm a pretty laid back, agreeable guy. There's some horrible characters on reddit but I assure you I'm no racist, holocaust denier, or anything of the sorts (the fact that I even have to include that is sad), I'm just an average guy who enjoys helping people. I mod a lot of subreddits, even though some are pretty small. Counter-Strike is my favorite game and having a role in the largest community for Counter-Strike would be wonderful. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this, look forward to hearing back from you guys	10-12 months	I love the sub, I've been subscribed since I began playing CSGO seriously in June of last year. Though I dislike how much it's about the pro scene. I appreciate the pro scene, but I've always like the amazing AWP shot gifs and tales of games posted by average players like myself instead of hearing what some pro says about a nerf or buff. Though some people insist it's "only joking", I dislike the attitude towards lower ranks. I started as a Silver I and now I'm an MG2 and I remember people just being condescending and rude when I posted threads for advice, even when I asked for advice on a new mouse. Though this represents a very small minority of the community and I love how helpful and supportive this community can be and enjoy being a part of it. 
6/1/2015 23:31:49	http://www.reddit.com/user/poopbutter778/	GMT-4	18	No	Yes	is fun jajajaja	is nooby jajajaja	I like eggs	19-24 months	everybody is fucking retarded
6/2/2015 0:07:26	https://www.reddit.com/user/bestindawork	GMT-4	17	I do, I was hired by multiple companies to do some search engine optimization to their websites, as well as designing custom CSS and HTML for clients. I have made some Python applets (games as well as functional programs using regular expressions to filter data). I have helped on PHP programs but am less proficient in it. I have used Javascript in both programming for sites and in the game engine Unity 5.	I am a server admin (admin Gabe/ bestindawork) for the Unofficial Reddit Cup 3, this is a popular tournament that is run for the Reddit community. This entailed having to actively monitor games and set up GOTV connections as well as executing CEVO configurations and recording server demos.	The community nights I have attended have always been fun and well organized. So far my favorite was FMPone's mirage 2 (greybox) play test it was fun to explore this map while meeting people from the community.	As a silver 2, I would read Newbie Thursdays to try to improve, this is what lead me to channels such as WarOwl or adreN making me improve and helping me get out of silver.	My name is Gabriel, I am an active part of the CSGO community, I like to help out where ever I can, from suggesting fixes, doing overwatch and trying to help with servers. I want to go that extra mile and help administrate the best subreddit, to set up community nights making these enjoyable and helping out all the newbies coming to this game from LoL or any other game.	10-12 months	I think that for the most part the /r/GlobalOffensive community is very nice, I am a little tired of seeing steam workshop files on the reddit because there is a totally different subreddit for things like that. I like the fact that there are tags, but I feel like they need a little more advertising and if they were used more often it would be easier for people to browse the subreddit. 
6/2/2015 0:19:11	http://reddit.com/user/rsv2207	UTC+1	19	Nope, but willing to learn	Admin'd a surf server (HLG on eu) for nearly 5 months. Had to keep the community in line etc etc.	For the times i've been, good but a little unorganized.	I don't feel as though this helps anyone, it'd be better to have a subreddit dedicated to helping lower skilled players I.E /r/leagueoflegends system	My name is Russ, i'm 19 from England. I am studying computing at college and have plenty of free time on my hands, i also would like to start streaming quite a bit. I used to play LoL semi professionally, but then moved onto CSGO and have been hooked since, i can honestly say that the cs community is better than league. But even so its not that, that keeps me playing. Its the tense clutchs, the thrills, the defeats, the wins. It always keeps me on the edge of my seat. I'm quite an innovative person, and if i was to be placed as an mod. I'd like to set up a group to create statistics and match pages for CSGO pro games. It's something that would interest me, and could be put on the side bar so that the posts don't get clogged up. 	7-9 months	Its a decent community, although i feel (and i have spoken to mods about this) that some of the rules are rather thin line, for example witch hunting. Seems to be okay about pro's (I.E Kfish betting scandle again) but for any other random human its a bit different. As an example of how the kfish scandle could be offensive i have a member of kfish on my friends list from when i played a league match against them, if i saw that post, i could give him beef about it. Same way if there was a post about some randomer and i had them on my friends list. Same issue. I have discussed this with mods, but i feel as though being critical in this kind of role is more of an advantage than a disadvantage.
6/2/2015 0:22:39	http://www.reddit.com/user/instinxx	GMT+1	19	I would not be in a position to help with coding.	I used to be head admin for a gaming community which involved hosting and maintaining servers for Counter Strike.  The Counter Strike servers were hosted on a server hosting service. I manually setup the server and configured it. I also installed various plugins and configured them.	I think the community night is a great way for the community of /r/GlobalOffensive  to participate in an event which allows them to meet each other, make friends and have some fun.  Community events like this allow users to feel more engaged and turn a subreddit into a real community.  	Simple idea that is very effective.  Having newbie Thursday posts encourages people to post any questions they have about the game without the fear of being down voted or insulted for their lack of knowledge. It is also effective at bringing more detailed answers and discussion, whereas individual posts may have lower quality replies or be ignored all together.  It is also effective at lowering the number of individual posts that may be created related to learning about the game, instead people can read through old newbie Thursday posts or ask their questions in the current newbie Thursday post.	I am from the UK and a University student. I have played Counter Strike since 1.6 and have continued to play the series to this point. I have managed to obtain Global Elite and would consider myself to have extensive knowledge of Counter-Strike and the competitive scene.   I have moderated in various places including web forums with 500-1000 active users at any time, to being head admin of a gaming community with 200+ active members. These opportunities have allowed me to gain skills and experience when communicating with a community and handling various scenarios appropriately and effectively.  It's in my nature to be helpful to others, I simply enjoy being able to help people no matter how big or small the issue is and always try and see things from other peoples point of view.   I would love to improve the community I am apart of for others to enjoy and would happily spend large quantities of time to do so. I am aware that moderating a community, especially of this magnitude is no easy task and requires multiple hours per day to go through what would be considered boring tasks. I already spend multiple hours on Reddit per day and I would be thrilled to be able to make a difference while doing so.	19-24 months	I would say that /r/GlobalOffensive has a good balance within the community. There is content which is high quality and discusses the game thoroughly and there is also content to simply enjoy and have a laugh.   A good middle ground of content is personally what I like the most within a community, as I can always find something which I want to look at. Whether that be jokes, montages or discussion about the current state of the game and so on.  Of course with all communities this large there will be toxic people, but that is something which can be handled either through moderation when necessary or by the community down voting.   The moderation of /r/GlobalOffensive is something I respect. Even in a large community the moderators keep on top of everything and have a great balance of heavy moderation and leniency. Moderation with a too heavy approach can cause problems with the community and could have backlash.

Games Design and Development student in Sydney AU. Calm and friendly, play CS and view /r/GlobalOffensive daily. Been playing CS for 10 years. Started playing competitive mid last year (started in silver now LE). Enjoy TV shows, movies, games, music. Been in a few bands mostly as guitarist. Know how to work with others to get things done. I am not desperate to be a mod or anything, I never have been one before. I just feel if I was picked then I could do good here and if not then no loss for me. I love creativity and thrills so CS is my game!	10-12 months	A lot of negative and unintelligent individuals but as a whole a great community. I find this the most interesting part about the community. I love helping people because it just feels good. I can deal with negative and stupid comments they are no issue. What this community does daily impresses me so I will always be happy.
6/2/2015 2:29:48	http://reddit.com/user/xxlegitxxpanda	GMT-7	16	I have a fair amount of HTML coding, although I am quite rusty at it. I have not really had any other experiences with coding, but am always interested in learning.	I have not had any experiencing CS:GO servers, although I have moderated other servers such as minecraft. 	I love to have community nights, with players from Reddit Surfing, Bhoping, playing some Casual, or even competitive-type game-modes!	I love the though of Newbie Thursdays, giving the lower ranks (such as my self) some feedback on how we can improve at the game!	Hello, I'm Daniel Smith. I'm a 16 year old male, Junior in high school (soon to be 17 year old Senior) and I'm extremely passionate about friendships and video games. After graduating from high school, I plan on going into the Army or the Air Force into a Cyber Security field (such as hacker). I do currently work (not too often) for a video game mobile theater so I'm always around consoles and my PC. I'm just about always in reach whenever I am not in school on my Skype/Teamspeak3 (if needed can give). The reason that I would like to be a Moderator for this specific subreddit is because I enjoy having responsibilities. I love being able to have something to do, and be counted on. I am on my computer just about all of the time so I could just about always be moderating the Subreddit. I am a little socially awkward, but I love getting out of my comfort zone and breaking the anxiety I get from talking with large groups of people. If this is a problem, I do understand. I've played CS:GO for a little while now, (not sure how long, I have about 600 hours on) and know a standard amount about the game. If I am needed to give more information I can most certainly do so! Thank you sooooo much for taking your time to read my application, and for giving me, a fellow Reddit community member, a chance at being a Moderator for your Subreddit! Thanks so much!	0-3 months	I do like the way that the /r/GlobalOffensive community is currently be handled, and personally would love to give my sense of a helping hand in making the job even a little easier for everyone. I haven't had any problems with any mod/community member on this subreddit.
6/2/2015 4:12:20	http://reddit.com/u/FR3D99	GMT+10	15	Lol I wish, minimal knowledge of VB, thats about it.	Not on CS:GO no. Does Minecraft count?	I'd love to join, if there were Australian servers. -_-	Good stuff I like to lurk.	I am Australian, and every community needs an Australian. But other then that I'm probably useless. I could (And already do) dedicate a lot of time here, and I like people, so that's a plus. Did I tell you I'm Australian? Well, I am. Australian, that is.   I'm fluent in this 'english' you speak of, and have also learned 'Interwebz speek' from other uneducated reddit communities, such as /r/ConsoleMasterRace .   I'm an overall lovely person if I do say so myself, being Australian and all.   Did I emphasis how I'm Australian? I feel like I'm going to have a lot of competition that have the edge over me, so I gotta find somewhere I can get a foothold and climb the ranks.   I like CS:GO a lot, mostly because I'm bad at it. Its good fun.   I'm an active trader, and I often use /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade to attempt to turn a profit or grab a new fancy looking skin to make me feel like I've actually accomplished something in life.  Anyway, that about sums me up. I'm mature and all that, and of course I'm very good at following and enforcing specific rule sets.  Thanks for reading good sirs!  -FR3D99, (/id/FR3D99, /r/FR3D99, or Matt) :)  P.S. Did I tell you I'm Australian?	10-12 months	They are beautiful people, wouldn't you agree? DelayedArtisticGuppy
6/2/2015 4:43:14	http://reddit.com/user/flamessey	GMT+1	20	Yes, currently studying computer science with experience in languages as: C, C++, HTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS and JAVA.  These languages i have learned over the course of 3 years studying and doing free time projects. Had to make hardware and physical objects like an automated door with alarm protection using C with an arduino and raspberry pi. Besides that my web pased coding comes mostly from classes plus having to create a serious game and phone app for a company which they wanted to take in production. Also i am going to work with my friend on several other projects to create a whole statistics website mostly LoL related (since we both are math geeks) and i will help him to create a interface program for a twitch channel. With c++ i am doing my internship with that basically creating a measurement system to measure power, voltage etc on hardware components in the computer. This is an ongoing project and still working on expanding it more with other features which comes from the VU hospital in the Netherlands. 	Not a lot of experience with csgo servers. Have my own VPS because of a job im working at and sometimes use that to setup a private server quickly so we can do a 5v5 or do some other fun maps together. Based on linux it is setup and completely monitorized by myself. Other than that i have been admin in other private server games as Maplestory with Extalia private server. Quit during the lack of motivation of the game back then. Had private mod group and discussed the random events we hosted and new rules etc. 	community night is a good way to get reddit users to play together and have fun other than interacting via reddit. As for users on reddit a lot of them are quiet and dont put frequent comments so they lack the interaction with other users. This is another great way to setup ways of putting them together and experiencing the people you read about and talk to. Also the use of moderators in community nights is awesome. Mostly people look up to mods and admins and really would want to be friends with them. During these nights its good to see that mods and admins are not just machines that do their job but can also have fun and interact with everyone on a fun note.	As for myself i have not used newbie thursday to my advantage since i had quite some experience with FPS games and counter strike. But when users are new to the game and use this as a way to answer their questions then it totally fits. I used to have the problem too that with complete different games you would not always have people you can ask stuff to if youre in need of help and these newbie thursdays are good for them to open up with "noob" questions where nobody is going to judge them if they ask "is there also a bomsite C?" because they are a new player and people are really nice to eachother in it.	I'm patrick (yes patrick star) and live in the Netherlands. Currently 20 years old and study computer science with some experience in coding. Besides that i work at Hostnet which is a webhosting and domainname company. I work at the customer service for about 2 years now and have a lot of experience with customers in that way (like the reddit community is). Having to handle and deal with hard to listen customers and also nice ones is something i have worked on a lot with the help of my colleagues. I have also worked for ESL as a LoL cup admin for a few months organising cups as go4lol and online qualifiers.   I am having enough time to moderate this subreddit besides that since it might seem like im busy. Whereever i am, at school, at work i always have reddit open and will be there to help out with anything. If anything is needed i will be able to put the time in there to fix it.  Im having a lot of fun helping other people and that is what i love to do. I would love to be part of the admin team here. I would want to show that admins are there for help but also your friend and can be just as trollish and fun as anyone else without insulting anyone.  I am looking to expand my knowledge from school and work and apply that to reddit. Also i do take critism and feedback very seriously and always want to improve further. If needed i can look up some forms from my work where they state my current situation there and how they think of me (although its in dutch).   Thank you for your time and i hope to see you soon in the mod team :) - Patrick	10-12 months	The community has shaped quite well from my understanding. As im original from the league subreddit i would say the csgo subreddit does act more mature to things. I understand that not everybody on here is mature or old enough to understand everything and have a proper conversation about it. For example during the whole flusha situation with his "mouse lifting" there were times where things may have gotten out of hand. Basically searching for any piece of possible hacks so that they can accuse the pro, not only him but almost everyone. As for my opinion i think this outrage was going quite far and should have been taken a little more action towards. Basically it insults the players and destroys their attitude without any evidence. There is limited to no evidence by just watching a demo with xray on. It might have been better that mods show that this might not have been very acceptable since there was a lot of these posts. It might have put the mods in a bad reputation but it is wrong to accuse anyone without proper evidence.   Besides this whole scenario i believe that the community has shaped up a lot. Basically it just stopped and people stopped caring about it whereas now it is a whole lot cleaner and a nice place to be. I hope to achieve that there will be more community events so that we can all interact with each other and have a good time with the community.

6/2/2015 8:13:20	http://reddit.com/user/pront0cs	GMT+4	17	Unfortunately no, I've never been able to learn any coding except for like some coding to do GMod MOTD's, Source Mod configuring, and other like small time coding.	I have been an admin on Several Servers through out the years, not just CSGO:  -4 Months of ScoutzKnivez Admining - CS:S - TitanClan (Currently Sponsored by RGN)  -3 Months of Jailbreak Admining - CS:S - TitanClan aswell  -4 Months of DarkRP Admining - Gary's Mod - MantisClan  -5 Months of owning a Server for Scrims - CS:GO - My own personal use/for team use 	I think a fun night would be a Featured Stream night, basically a lottery for CS:GO Streamers whom have put a lot of time into Streaming and don't have an audience, but feel they deserve one. A Google form like this one could be used and then once or twice a month they could get a link to he or she's twitch pinned on the frontpage. I think this would be a stellar way to show love to all levels of the streaming community of CS:GO. Some people stream everyday with little to no recognition and this could give them the spotlight they need.	I think this is a great way for people to not feel silly about asking a question they might consider "dumb" or "stupid".	Hi! I'm /u/pront0cs. I'm currently 17 years old. I'm graduating High School in less than 10 days, and will be attending SUNY Plattsburgh in the fall. I'll be majoring in Broadcast Communications and looking to later get a job in Radio or TV production. When i'm not playing Counter Strike or on my computer in general, i'm probably obsessing over a new show on Netflix. I played my first game of Counter Strike: Source in 2008 and have never stopped playing. I play both casually and competitively. Besides owing a lot of my interest in Video Games because of /r/GlobalOffensive, I also owe them a large portion of my improvement from Silver 2 aka My first ever MM Rank. I'm now AK1, but I try to just play alternative match making like CEVO or AltPug. Other than that info, I'm a mod over on /r/CSskinSwap, a sort of unused sub reddit for people looking to swap skins of same condition but different wear/stickers. Thanks for reading my app, and please consider me for Mod, you won't regret it.	4-6 months	/R/globaloffensive is what really got me into Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Before I found this subreddit, I really just casually played CS:S and not much else. I later found that not only would I later become with CS:GO, but also with Video Games, computer parts, and other video games. I owe a lot of my happiness in video gaming to this sub.
6/2/2015 8:28:50	http://reddit.com/u/powerchicken	UTC+1	23	Have experience with HTML, CSS and JS/jQuery, know some basic python. Am not particularly good at making things look pretty.	Administrate the TS3 server for the DayZ community I co-run (/r/redditrescueforce), hosted by nfoservers.com which I would call the best hosting service out there. Haven't had a second of downtime in over a year. Have co-administrated a CS:S Surf/RPG/DM server back in the day.	Haven't participated, I almost exclusively play 5-man premade matchmaking/ESEA with a predominantly British community.	Excellent initiative, have occasionally responded to questions in them.	My name is Ari, I'm from the Faroe Islands, currently living in Denmark, and I've been playing CS on and off since 1.3, meaning I practically grew up with the game.   English is my third language, but I like to believe it's on par with native speakers.    I'm on reddit up to 12 hours a day, typically idling with my /r/toolbox chrome extension sending me notifications in case I receive a reply/modmail/report/etc. I have experience with reddit moderation, running the once-largest DayZ community /r/redditrescueforce before the game died down.  I play everything from chess to FPS to Paradox grand strategy games. My favourite games of all time are Fallout 2, Diablo 2, Jagged Alliance 2 (can't count to 3) and naturally CS. I am currently ranked LE, but don't particularly care about my ranking.   I regularly attend Airsoft events.  Anything missing?	13-18 months	In my experience the community became incredibly toxic following the initial boom of the competitive scene, with far too many personal witch hunts. The community seems to have matured a great deal since then (whether that's due to a change in mentality or frequent bashes with the banhammer, I don't know), and most threads seem to consist of fairly high-quality content, whether humorous or not.    On the other hand, I'm not a fan of low-effort 'twitch-chat' comments occasionally making their way to the top of otherwise serious topics. 
6/2/2015 8:46:52	http://reddit.com/u/attaint	GMT+10	19	Very basic HTML and CSS. Willing to learn!	I was a long-time admin on a CS:S server a few years ago called Surf-Infamous (one of the most popular in Australia). We ran Jailbreak, Minigames, Surf, Deathrun and TF2 servers. My name was and always has been attaint during gameplay.	Haven't been to one only because they are usually in the American/European time zone and I reside in Australia, but a very good idea nonetheless and have heard that it is quite fun and successful!	Very good idea, I've used it a couple times to help some newer people to the game and introduce them to some basic mechanics to the game.	I'm 19 and I live in Sydney, Australia. I'm on reddit pretty much as much as I'm awake because I always have it open in the background. I've wanted to moderate a subreddit for a long time as I spent a lot of my time on reddit and what better subreddit to have the change to moderate than GlobalOffensive as that is the game I'm most active in currently. I also play several other games such as GTA V and Dota 2, so I am knowledgeable in the games that are currently being talked about in the gaming community. 	13-18 months	Lots of "shitposting" currently, although they are heavily moderated and aren't too much fluff for the subreddit as to drown out very relevant content. The subreddit has grown exponentially over the last year and it's been great to see it go this far!

We were trying with Clan I mention above to host CS:GO server but due financial problems, we did not make any agreement. But still I'm not clueless in this topic.	Pretty cool idea, I was about to join it once, but mumble had won this fight.	Very helpfull, even me on SMFC ranks use information given there from time to time. I'm also pretty active there.	I'm 21 years old, handsome male with beard. Besides of OC and CS:GO I also try my powers on snowboard (for 6y..). I do like communicate with others, even helping from time time!   I spend a lot of time on reddit during my normal hours work, so being an important part of this community would make it even more atractive for me to come here more frequently (if it's possible... I spend here LOTS of time)  Also I might make some typos and mistakes when I write in English, it's not my native one. Not trying to justify.. but. yeah.  And I've never manage to make a post that would intrest somebody... I've always consider it as a shame. But I'm working on some clip, so maybe soon!   TL;DR I like reddit. Much love.  Best Regards, Kisielos 'aka' Jelly in English	10-12 months	It's looking better than on MM servers or on steam group. Less troll, mostly ppl that want to help. Overall very positive.

I love to travel and meet new people, and volunteer every summer in an NGO by staffing international summercamps for a couple of weeks.  I've discovered CSGO at the beginning of 2014, it was on sale on Steam and I had decided to stop playing Dota 2 because it was taking me too much time. It might not have been the best idea to start CSGO if I wanted to save time, but here I am.  I also have a little experience about moderating, I used to moderate a rather big french forum. I'm not giving you my application because I want to get some power from it or anything, but it seems that you guys need help and since I spend a lot of time on my computer I might as well give you a hand.  Cheers!   PS : Here is my Steam if you want to chat with me or just want to donate some knives ;) http://steamcommunity.com/id/arnaudsuisse	13-18 months	I actually love it. You can have huge circlejerks about how Flusha is hacking or that the game is unplayable because of 64-ticks, but at the same time you can also have interesting discussions about the competitive scene, tips for new players, and hilarious videos or shitposts.
6/2/2015 12:56:54	http://www.reddit.com/user/frecel	GMT-7	25	Yes. I have experience with HTML5 for web as well as mobile applications. I'm familiar with Python, Ruby, NodeJS and have some experience writing C++.  One of my project is /u/SoonRaccoon a bot made for /r/TheBrainscoop that posted new videos from TheBrainscoop Youtube Channel to the subreddit. Currently not working due to YT abandoning the RSS feeds.  I upload some of my code to github (https://github.com/frecel) 	I have never hosted a CS:GO server but I have hosted servers for other games like Quake3, Urban Terror, Assault Cube and many others as well as Mumble and TeamSpeak2 and 3 servers.   All of it was hosted on Virtual Private Servers, with everything set up manually through ssh. Most of the time I use Ubuntu as the OS, but I have used Debian and CentOS on servers in the past. I have no experience with Microsoft Servers. 	I have never participated in a Community Night game but I think any effort to engage the community is a great idea. 	I think it's a good way to avoid getting new threads with the same, commonly asked questions over and over. It is also a good way to get traffic to the subreddit since there is a chance that if someone googles a question an answer posted in r/GlobalOffensive will show up in the results.	My name is Artur, I was born and lived most of my live in Poland but currently reside and work in Canada. I am fluent in Polish and English. I pay my bills by welding and enjoy programming and gaming as a hobby, I am also a big Linux enthusiast.   Growing up in Poland it was hard to avoid contact with CS so I played some 1.6 and Source but I never really got into it until last year when CS:GO came to Linux and I've been hooked since.  I have some experience moderating in communities of varying size starting from small servers for a group of friends to a php MUD-like game with 5000+ players as well as some small subreddits.   Due to the fact that I work in natural gas industry my work schedule is somewhat strange. I often work for a few weeks 12h+ a day and then come back home for a few weeks off so my activity on Reddit will change depending on which part of my work cycle I'm in.  r/GlobalOffensive became my main source of CS:GO related news and I hope the community keeps growing and the quality of content posted to this subreddit keeps improving. It would be my pleasure to help the community as a moderator would you choose to give me a chance to do so.	0-3 months	Given the size of r/GlobalOffensive I'm honestly impressed with the quality of the comments on this subreddit, especially if you compare it to the behaviour of a lot of people you can expect to meet in game. Even on very popular posts you have scroll down quite a bit before you get to the angry comments and everything above is a civilized discussion, this includes threads with a controversial topic. I don't know if it's due to good moderation or if it's just a really good crowd, I suppose it's a mix of both. Either way, good job r/GlobalOffensive community.  What I don't like about the community is the amount of complaining that is going on about hackers, salty players etc. compared to what the community is doing to fix it. This applies to both r/GlobalOffensive and r/CounterStrike. Granted there are always ideas in the comments as to what Valve could do to correct the problem but there is a lot the community can do to fix these issues. For example I would like to see some effort from the community to start organizing old school pickup games on IRC or elsewhere which could solve most of the issues people are complaining about.
6/2/2015 14:40:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/Eloth/	GMT+0	17	programmed l0 and l1 controls for LHCb subdetectors (python + PVSS) programmed sublat/sublon calculator and map plotting tools for Global JetWatch (python)  I've only done work in python and C, though I've done some home projects with Javascript.	I've run Minecraft and TF2 servers for my friends. That's it.			Okay, well. I've got some moderating experience on reddit (I moderate /r/kayaking). I don't know what else you want!  I'm good at working with others, and dealing with issues. I coach Sea Scouts in kayaking on a weekly basis, help out at the local kayaking club, and am also an avid whitewater kayaker in my spare time. So yeah, I'm qualified in first aid, emergency care, and swiftwater rescue, if that helps. I'm also a proficient violinist. I have a 10 metre swimming certificate, and can hold my breath for at least one minute.	19-24 months	I think it's a good, active community. That's not to say it's without its issues -- which are usually adequately policed, whether that be by its moderators, or even other users. That said, there's a lot of negativity towards certain groups -- russians, for instance -- but I don't know what can be done to curtail this. I've only noticed it recently, but this kind of thing seems to be the only example of a comment that I'd consider unacceptable that isn't immediately downvoted to hell.
6/2/2015 15:53:33	http://www.reddit.com/user/waoHelios/	GMT-5	21	Very, very, VERY minor experience with HTML/Javascript, as in I took a couple of classes back in highschool, but I'm a quick learner, and a good bit of my friends code, and I can pick up what I don't know from them.	CS:GO specifically, no. I helped run a few small time WoW private servers, and minecraft servers way back in the day. 	Honestly I think this is a great aspect of the community, I haven't participated in any myself since I've been scrimming, and practicing on my own, but none-the-less I think it's a great feature. Potentially we should consider doing a Community Night tournament, rather than just 10mans.	I haven't participated, nor really looked at this. 	I've been helping run small communities for several years now, back in 2011 I started helping out over at teamwarfareleague.com (back before it was bought out and run into the ground, I swear it used to actually be a pretty decent site!) doing Shoutcasting and Prediction threads, as well as running the schedule for teams. Eventually I started doing the same thing, minus the scheduling over at cevo.com for Call of Duty when they re-opened CEVO.   I've helped run several top end raiding guilds in WoW, scheduling times, running forums, and dealing with member conflicts, forums are definitely not new to me, and I'm a bit of a /r/GlobalOffensive/new/ nerd anyways, I like to try and catch interesting threads before they blow up.  Other than what I've done as far as position related stuff goes, I'm working on playing my first actual competitive season of CS:GO coming up next ESEA season, I'm a Jazz Musician, and occasionally I stream when I feel like my aim isn't particularly awful!	7-9 months	Personally I think /r/GlobalOffensive sits on the polar opposite of /r/LeagueOfLegends, it feels like a lot slides through the ranks that shouldn't, but also a lot of good content makes it's way through. I think moderation could be a bit more strict with preventing duplicate threads such as the VacStatus threads, yeah they're great to see, but 4 of them popping up to the front page every week is tiresome, a MegaThread could do for that. Same thing with new operations, patches, and cases, it'll just help clean up some of the clutter on the front page.
6/2/2015 16:50:43	http://www.reddit.com/user/FireandStorm	GMT-4	18		I have been an admin on a very small clan forum for my friends, about 4 or 5 years ago when we played World of Warcraft together.		I really enjoy seeing players learn new things, and even learn a new thing myself.	I'm an 18 year old living in Blue Ridge, GA. I'm honest and kind, but very straight-forward, I also take positions of authority very seriously. I Just recently graduated high school and I play CS:GO and come to /r/GlobalOffensive as much as i can. 	0-3 months	I really enjoy the community! I'm new to the subreddit, but I have lurked before and I definitely enjoy going on the subreddit every day.
6/2/2015 17:43:48	http://www.reddit.com/user/Cribbit/	GMT-7	20	I am currently employed by Amazon, programming in Java and Lisp.   Of those listed above, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. 	I have none. 	I think it's excellent, and would like to see it happen more often. I really like that it gives an opportunity for map makers to get a larger player pool for testing. Getting playtesters can be one of the hardest things for mapmakers. 	It needs a catchier name, but is great for helping new players.   I think it would be great to compile a FAQ out of it, as there are some excellent answers posted in there by some experienced players.   I think it would be fun to try to get a pro player or team to "sponsor" a thursday every now and then, where they help to answer questions in addition to the normal people. 	http://forums.steamrep.com/search/member?user_id=809&content=thread - any that are still pending will be evidence provided in a few days. I always try to help the community however I can. In addition to reporting every scammer I can get proof on, I help ensure that other, less experienced posters provide all the info required so their report can be processed.   I am a very well known user of /r/hardwareswap, where I've bought or sold over 100 computer parts. I build and sell computers as a hobby.  While I am not in the EU timezone, I keep late hours and am very active.   	7-9 months	I think bandwagoning is rampant, and it can be hard for dissenting opinions to be heard. This is natural for the format that reddit provides. I think zero fucks sunday is a great way to combat this and leads to interesting discussion.    I think in general this community is great, and healthier than most other subreddits. Though there will always be fluff, the sub is good at creating (or at least collating) some good content. The new queue can be a little harsh at times to people asking dumb things. 
6/2/2015 20:03:45	http://www.reddit.com/user/TrixForKidz/	GMT-4	23	Java - minimal HTML - minimal	yes -- i have had many 1.6 servers, and did my own ftp/server work as I had an extended family member who owned a minor dial up isp and computer repair shop back in the day.	meh	i like reading the questions. you never know when you'll learn something new, and sometimes you can help someone else out in the process.	I spend most of my free time playing cs and browsing globaloffensive.  i go to school for geology live in ny im easy going, and not one to start a beef. im pretty nice. same old shit.	19-24 months	/r/GlobalOffensive is the best. i don't have reddit on my favorites bar, i have globaloffensive on my bar.  90% of the time people are on the subreddit to help out.
6/2/2015 20:10:12	http://www.reddit.com/user/highonmushroom	UTC+1	17	I have some basic knowledge in both HTML and CSS. Don't know much more about the other languages.	No experience.	I love the idea of Community Nights, but I havent acually participated in one, since I dont really have any interesst playing new maps unless I know they will come in a operation in the future since I purely play Counter Strike for the compeditive scene. I guess community nights are more of a fun expirence than what I am looking for, if that makes any sense.	I love Newbie Thursdays, I always read through that post and the comments atleats twice evey week. I seem to always find something new to learn. I wouldnt consider myself as a newbie but the tips always seem useful there. 	Hello, I am Rasmus; I usually go by the nicknames Slutmagnet, HighOnMushroom or Knarkbjorn. Currently I am living in Stockholm, Sweden and as I mentioned earlier I am 17 years old. I am attenting a IT-high school, which I am majoring in social studies and media. I got basic knowledge in HTML and CSS, and I also have decent expierence in Adobe programs as Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign and After Effects. I can also speak and write fluid English and Swedish; I've also got very basic knowledge in Spanish.   On my spare time I tend to spent it either with my girlfriend or at home playing games. I haven't played video games for very long. I started when I were 13, which was when I bought my first gaming PC. Since then I've spent over 2000 hours on TF2 and about 1000 on Counter Strike GO. TF2 has been my main game, my go to game, my home pretty much. I often lurked around on the TF2 subreddit but recently I have made the official leap over to CSGO because I think the developers of TF2 wasn't really giving the game much attention and spent their time fixing the wrong things. Pretty much how /r/GlobalOffensive is feeling; atleast that's the feeling I get when I watch the front page of this subreddit.   Fun fact: The Team Fortress 2 community looks up to the CSGO like the CSGO is looking up to Dota 2. In the manner of getting well deserved updates and in-game features. Which brings me to why I really want to be a moderator of /r/GlobalOffensive.   I really think that Counter Strike: GO can blow up even more; get even bigger, just what I thought of Team Fortress 2. But the community in TF2 didn't do enough to show the developers what they needed and what the impact would be if they didnt listen. And that is the main reason why I think TF2 has died. That is the thing that I don't want to happen to CSGO, and this subreddit is the key to that.   My goal is to make a difference in the Counter Strike: Global Offensive community and the game even, which is what really motivates me.  Thanks, Rasmus	7-9 months	In my opinion, the /r/GlobalOffensive community is pretty good. The things that are important/interessting/funny gets the deserved amount of upvotes and there is no shitposts; atleast of what I get to see. So that means that either the community is doing everything right by no need of mods or that the mods are doing what's needed, 
6/2/2015 22:41:32	http://www.reddit.com/user/grimpwnsu	GMT-4	15	Slight CSS nothing much other than that	I have been a moderator of a surf server for a while before I stopped using the server. 	I think it's cool that the community is coming together to play games and 5v5s. I personally have never participated in them but wouldn't mind doing so. 	I like Newbie Thursday but I like adopt a silver a lot more because it is a more 1 on 1 coaching environment that can help more than getting an answer over reddit.	I've played CSGO for around a year. I have over 600 hours on GO but I have never played CSS or 1.6. I am an avid trader and spend time on /r/globaloffensivetrade. I am ranked DMG and I like to help people of lower ranks or need help with certain things. I would love to be a mod because I spend lots of time on the sub and I would like to help keep the sub clean while browsing it at the same time :)	10-12 months	I have not seen too many mod or mod action during my time at /r/globaloffensive. I think the community is cool and I am glad that they are willing to help each other out and have participate in community things. I really have no problems with the community. 
6/3/2015 0:11:38	https://www.reddit.com/user/thatsnot_eye_roll/	GMT-4	2	I coded the matrix and the core cerebrum to the chamber's netcode apparatus that is locking the gate to your mom's vagina. 	I admined Minecraft servers and your mother's vagina. 	Needs more dank memes. Blows more than your father. 	Let's me know who are the noobs so if I ever see them in a game I either rek them or cry myself to sleep knowing I am on the same level to be in a game with him/her. 	I produce the dankest of maymays, majoring in the study of jetfuel and its effects on steel beams.   Global elite in spirit, Silver 1 in skill. 	5+ years	Jet fuel can't melt steel beams. They're more inconsistent than this game's hitboxes. They're silver with their manners, but global elite in egos. They probably all rush in b every round and yell cyka blyat why you no push when they die first. 
6/3/2015 9:13:02	http://www.reddit.com/user/RoadSign5	GMT+1	22	Just finished University in Business Information Technology. Did my major in PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.	I own a server for team practices and smoke testing.	I never seem to catch them and it always seems more NA than EU/UK stuff.	I like newbie Thursday because it gives me something to read during the day and I learn new things that I don't think about or didn't wanna ask. I normally lurk on them because everything I want to know seems to already be addressed.	I've always enjoyed playing video games and I've always wanted to give something back to it. I've been trying to help communities grow for years. I first started by commentating for "WGL"(Now Gfinity) when they originally started up. This then lead to me Head reffing/ moderating for http://www.vanity-esports.com/ tournaments. I have also helped WGL run the i44 Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 (XBOX) Tournament.	19-24 months	Over time I've liked the growth of the subreddit and the expansion of other subreddits about the game such as "/r/VAC_Porn" (It's worth a look). some of my favourite things is the game tutorials that the community makes. This has helped me develop my game with smoke/flash plays and how to improve my aim. I have jumped from Silver 4 to MG1 thanks to these.
