The only subreddit and actually only place on reddit that I check at least a few times a day is /r/globaloffensive. I do enjoy the community here more than other gaming/social websites.

I have been playing CS seriously since 2013 with some very casual 1.6 times way back when (more than 10 years ago). I follow the pro scene vigorously, with my favorite team being Dignitas (don't hate, device is the bomb) and my favorite player is Schneider , who I hope will be in the next LGB. I am a mod of his stream aswell. I was also an ex mod of /r/csgobetting and admin of the teamspeak when it was up. The reason I was no longer a mod is because I went inactive during my exam period. I do provide some analysis time to time there, mostly on South African games. I have been in a few semi pro SA teams, and I am currently in a mix team who could do pretty well next year in Do Gaming League (DLG)  (A league where there are LAN finals at the end of this year). I use to play COD 4 semi pro as well.   I live in Johannesburg and starting next year, I start my first year of 6th Form college.   On CSGO, I usually play scrims on something we call Intoxicated Pickups. I sometimes also bhop and surf.   So yeah. That's me. So happy new years and I hope to hear back from you!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanTheHumann	GMT+2

I play CSGO a lot, and am currently on an ESEA-Open team. I follow the pro scene pretty extensively, watching matches when I can and reading/staying up to date. While being 15 is something that might deter you, I am mature. I can prove that fact being my team wants people who are 18+ but is fine with me because I am chill/mature. I thought it might be fun to try out for moderator of globaloffensive, since it is one of the main subreddits that i read through.  I am in high school currently, so availability completely depends on my school work/sports. I may or may not be doing spring sports, and if I do, that comes before csgo/reddit/etc.  I'm almost always online on steam, from ~4pm PST to 10:15PM PST(average weekday) or now, since i'm on break 10amPST to 11:30PM PST.   Anyways, I'd love a shot at becoming a mod for /r/globaloffensive   :D 	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050296145/	UTC-8

I am relatively new to Reddit but I already love the community. My father used to play the original counter strike and he gave me this steam account when I was young, didn't play much, at all, but when he moved away from my mother I wanted something to remind myself of him so I bought CSGO and now I love it. This is not a sob story so please do not take it as such. I am studying at Gunnersbury Catholic School in the UK and have taken two early GCSE's and will be taking the rest this year.  Online I spend the majority of my time on HackForums in the CS section (I don't cheat though) and have just launched a website: www.csgopub.com which is obviously a CSGO themed website.  The reason that I would like to become mod is, in all honesty, for respect. Yes, respect. Not because I am an attention whore, but I believe to help people, being in a position of power is extremely helpful because the simple fact is, althought it should not be like this, people listen to you more.   The reason that I think I would fit into being mod is because I live my online life by 3 simple motives, respect, dedication and kindness. I believe that these attributes are perfect for being mod.  I am mature, but can have a laugh and I will listen to everyone but show  authority when it is needed. Thanks for the opportunity.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecsgopub/	GMT+0

I'm 20 years old and as a hobby I play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. As for now, I don't have a real life job so many of my time is being spent on Reddit and CS:GO. Before I started playing CS:GO I was very active in coding and designing. I even have a huge amount of expirience in moding as I own a gaming forum ( http://www.yunited-balkan.info/forum/ ) which I designed. I have a big amount of knowledge when it comes to CSS and HTML, I spent countles hours working with both and improving my knowledge and skills. I would say I'm pretty good with them. However I didn't yet tryed the other listed languages/libraries/concepts more then editing some javascript and jQuery codes when I needed them.  Other then that, I was modeing on a big amount of gaming forums on the Balkan on my native language and have big expirience with that. I know that you might be looking for somebody from another timezone, but I'm online in almost every time, even the late night/early morning hours of my timezone.   One of my deficiencies is for sure the one that I only started using reddit about 5 months ago, but I'm familiar with most of Reddits funcitons and the usage of the same.     I guess I don't know much more to say, I said everything about myself that I think would be useful for you to know. If there is anything more you need or may want to know. Just hit me up with a PM on Reddit or add me on Steam.   Cheers, Lazar Mitrović. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazoBaa	UTC+1

So i wanted to fill out this application as i love CS:GO is basically the only think i play now and when im not playing it im watching videos or on this sub Reddit. I am at college in my last year studying  CISCO and IT. I feel like if i was able to become a mod for this sub Reddit then i would be able to help with alot of the questions that people have about the game and also about peoples PC's. I have free lanced as a computer technician fixing computers, creating websites and building computers. This gives me alot of knowledge about the type of questions that most people ask about such as why am i lagging what sort of fps will i get on this build and so on. I did not check the above box "well spoken, takes care in writing a response" as it is true i do take my time however im am dyslexic so i will take a bit longer to respond as ill need to proof read and check spellings but i thought it was better to let you guys know why i did not tick it.

Location: Florida, US Age: 27 Profession: Software Development in Test  Hello! I am putting my name in the ring for a r/globaloffensive mod. It is very exciting to see such colossal growth of our community (especially if you remember all the naysayers at the start). I know the subscriber base has grown considerably, and the mod team has done an impeccable job of coping with this. Handling of the controversial "Vaccening" incident is proof that the mod team is actively curating an increasingly chaotic domain.  Professionally, I write code that runs tests on my company's mobile application. I recently graduated University with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, blah blah blah whatever.  As a gamer, I tend to latch on to one particular game and play for way too long. It started with about 6 years of Quake2 (Rocket Arena 2, to be exact. I then went through long stints of Quake3, Day of Defeat, TF2, WoW (I know.... I know), and finally my long lost love, CS!   As a CS player, I have been at it casually since 1.3 (between games of quake3/dod of course), and competitively since global offensive came out. I currently have 3000+ hours in-game and over 1000 wins. I point this out to prove experience, not skill :). Nowadays I can only get in 1 or 2 games during the weekday, and maybe another 4 or 5 during the weekend. I currently watch more CS than I play.   During work, I always have a r/globaloffensive tab open, and I use it as an escape when I need a break. I currently watch more CS than I play, and I usually have a twitch stream playing while I work. I really enjoy helping intermediate players. I currently play lots of ESEA, occasionally playing MM for fun with friends.   My post history speaks for itself, but my main goal in most of my posts/comments is to make sure the readers has the proper perspective as it relates to the topic posted by OP.  I've been a longtime lurker in the globaloffensive (more recently, r/globaloffensive) IRC, under the nick Harmix. I usually talk during live matches.  This subreddit has come along way in just a few years, and has been very responsible in accommodating new players. I remember when all you would see were complaints about MM servers, stupid deathcam shots, and case opening videos.   Now I see weekly discussion threads on a range of topics, easy to follow grenade tutorials, and a really supportive and tight-knit community. It's a great time to be passionate about this game.  Please let me know if I can clarify any information for you guys. You guys have created a really special home for us here, so I wish you the best of luck on finding your new mod :)	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962157534	GMT-5

I may not be the nicest person, however I pride myself on being the fairest. I believe I'd be a great candidate for the position due to my overall persona as well as my knowledge about the game and the competitive scene.   Just a small little fact as well, I work in IT which means I have reddit open basically 24/7, so there will be no issues on the online time front.

During this time, I have got really into the pro scene, and follow almost every major tournament (I am a really big Dignitas fan :D). I try to bet too, but I always lose :(.   As the game is the centre of this community I would like to talk a bit about my time playing it. I have recently ranked down (a lot) from MG2  to SEM. However, this is mainly because I play FaceIt (screw 64 tick.) I also sort-of know how to bhop if you want someone who can impress the enemy team.   If you are interested in the coding aspect of my life, I took lots of courses in coding in my earlier days. I spent all my life coding and creating games for friends, that is before I discovered how fun actually playing the game can be. Here is a quick summary of my knowledge in them: - HTML- Completely fluent -CSS- Completely fluent -PHP- Eh, not that great -Python- Almost there -Linux/Ubuntu- Used to have a Ubuntu computer so, ya know.  Thanks for the opportunity! general 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/generalpricey/	UTC+1

I have 5,000+ hours in CS:S and 2,500+ hours in CS:GO. The only reason I made a reddit was so I could use the CS:GO reddit to express my ideas and report any sort of bugs or anything to the community. But now I'm pretty much addicted and check it every morning when I wake up before I do anything else. Also I check it every 2 hours if not more to see if there's any new content. It's pretty funny when my friends send me something and I'm like yeah, I already seen it. Anyways, I can deal with any issues in a mature and friendly manner and as you can tell I'm VERY active. I also play 4+ hours of CS:GO a day practicing with my team for ESEA. My life is pretty much CS:GO and reddit so to become a mod would kind of be a dream come true in a weird way. Anyways thank you for giving me the chance and I hope I make the cut. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kr4zeE/	GMT-6

I'm just going to put it here so you can see it.  Introduction - Hello, my name is Joseph 'Sinq' Fenech. I'm currently 16 years of age and attending my last term of year 10 highschool. I'm a active redditor and also an active CSGO player. Im also a huge supporter in competitive counter strike and I support most teams.  Experience - I like to think I have a good set of experience for jobs like this, so far I've done many different things to suit me up for a job like this. Currently I work at FACEIT.com as a administrator. I work live support so I have a lot of experience with talking to users and keeping my calm. I have also previously ran a forum under the name "SocialHex" which has been sold recently. I have also moderated and admin'd many different forums in my time online. Another thing I have done is I've owned a hosting company, I have learnt many different things from that experience and rules was a major part of that.  TimeZone - I'm located in Sydney, Australia with the timezone "GMT+11 or AEDT" This timezone from personal experiences I've found is a very flexible zone for admin'ing and MOD'ing, it gives a chance for NA/EU MODS to be able to go to sleep on-time and know that there will be someone on at all times.  Extra Information - Most employee's see my age as a negative but I would like to add that it could be a positive. I'm a vert mature individual and I would like to hope age does not matter within applications.  References -  Lulu - Head of Customer Support and Community Manager "Sinq joined us mid September and since then he has shown passion and knowledge of the game. He is one of our most dedicated admins and always willing to jump on and help. He is responsible and trustworthy. So far he did not miss any of the shifts he was supposed to attend and he has always been polite and understanding towards our users. He is proactive and a fast learner."  Polar - EU Community Manager "Sinq is a valued part of the FACEIT admin team, he is always on time and very dedicated even though we only offer it as a voluntary position" Thank you for reading my application, I hope we can speak further on the position.

I study BSc web development at university for which I am on my final year and I have been using reddit for a number a years along with browsing this subreddit for around a year.  I am a moderator over on /r/runescape and I have been so for just over 2 years, I have seen it rise from 1-2k subscribers upto 41k! /r/runescape is within the top 100 submission based subreddits which means we get a lot of people posting on a daily basis which means I am used to handling various situations. I have extensive knowledge of Automoderator (Local host as well as sitewide) that allows me to do all manner of things to help with the everyday running of the subreddit.  Although I might not have 1000+ hours on CSGO on my Steam account I do absolutely love the professional scene that is currently exploding all around the world, I might of ditched a weekend away because of Dreamhack Winter Championships (don't tell anyone this lol).  I am always freely available to help with anything even though I'm a student, I had dedicated lines of communication which means I can also be contacted even if I am afk. I'm also a great team player and I'll always listen to advice from those around me. My accounts e.g. reddit, steam and emails are all secured to the fullest and I always take security as a number one concern..  I'd love to help with any web projects you guys might have and I believe I can create anything you guys would like using the languages and services ticked above. I implemented the /r/runescape design using reddit CSS and a full version of the design is also available at /r/runescapecss which shows the extensive knowledge of reddit styling.  Either way /r/globaloffensive is growing to be something amazing and a vital place for csgo'ers to visit. I hope this continues for many years to come and thank you for reading this!

You ask me to sell myself, which is funny because I'm actually a salesman by day. I work at a car dealership, and have for quite a while. While at the dealership, I have extremely too much time on my hands. I frequent Reddit and regularly hang out in the /new section of CSGO.  I enjoy helping people while weeding out things that are not necessarily useful for the subreddit. I've had quite a bit of forum moderator positions in the past, and have aided in making the community a better place.  Three random facts about me - I have three kittens who are amazing. I initially wanted to be a journalist, but realized that there was zero money in journalism. I drink like 15 diet cokes a day. Seriously. Minimum of 12.

I often use reddit in which I usually browse the front page, /r/globaloffensive, /new/ of /r/globaloffensive, and the three subreddits I moderate. I mod /r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC, /r/makemeaplaylist, and /r/chancetherapper, of which all have upwards of 1k readers. I will often check these subreddits (only a few times a day due to their small size) and remove a ton of horrible posts on the new sections which usually consist of clickbait articles and otherwise stupid posts. e: I've also modded /r/IndieGaming but no longer do so.  In my free time, I spend time with friends and fam, attend school, do schoolwork, do homework, study, but I also play a lot of video games and reddit. I'd say around half of my redditing is done on mobile, but the reddit client I use offers moderating functions which makes it easier.  I found the "Choose the following attributes you would say define you." section of this form peculiar. It's not very easy to think things like these by yourself. I'd like to be fair when choosing these, but some of these options are things that others judge you about and not for one to choose themselves.  I'd like to elaborate on the programming experience. I am pretty good with HTML and CSS and use JavaScript for anything that goes beyond the boundaries of HTML/CSS in web design. I have never really done anything with PHP so much as learned it. My experiences with C# and Java are just mobile apps (Android and iOS) but it was just for trying the different design guidelines for the platforms. I know how to use Git/GitHub and Linux/Ubuntu without GUI as I have at most 2 years of experience with them when I ran servers for Minecraft (no longer) and Counter-strike: GO.  thanks for considering	http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanth3	UTC-5

I also enjoy doing various events/typing long rants about things that im passionate about and summing up various community stuff, this is my prime example and i poured all my heart into this Reddit project http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/wiki/community/problemsandsolutions  Response from the community about my work was heart warming so i continued working on that project and even got contacted by Microsoft engineer which said "ill make sure it gets into the hands of Windows team" and i guess it did, because lots of small bugs that were present for months suddenly disappeared after several updates.  Im a huge CS GO fan and player, even though i don't play as often. I mainly read/listen and watch CS content nowadays, i spend lots of time on Reddit on my phone. End of 2014 was quite a busy time for me, so i haven't had much time to play CS, i really want to and i try to get on as often as i can but you know.. You can't escape life, there's things that you need to do.  Also i should mention that im a co-owner of /r/MicrosoftBand subreddit, i pretty much made the whole subreddit myself since original owner had no idea how CSS works, im not as experienced with CSS as you guys are but im not a slouch either.  And finally there's several things that you need to know about my personality  1. Im passionate about things that i like(Football/CS/Windows platforms) 2. Im friendly and helpful as long as the person that needs help/explanation isn't an ass 3. I can take my time to work on various projects(Reddit project that i mentioned before took at least 3 hours per major update, but i loved every second i spent on researching/testing/typing) 4. I can easily get off to a long rant if i see a "stupid"/misleading/biased post, im not sure if that's a good thing but yeah... 5. I enjoy analyzing community, https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=survey&resid=D695216053C786A1!169414&authkey=!AP3hTAUqGNiW1kI&ithint=file%2cxlsx that's my quiz about Windows Phone and Microsoft ecosystem. 6. I love testing new things, i participated in variety of alpha/beta tests of various software.

Let me introduce myself. I'm a male twenty year old Californian. Since November of 2013 I've invested a large part of my free time into CS:GO, this is my first CS. I've become interested and involved in the professional side of the game as well. I am very active on the /r/globaloffensive subreddit, although I don't post often. I mostly lurk and post when I feel appropriate. I've been a redditor for about a year now and /r/globaloffensive has become my main sub that I visit and check up on frequently.  I've been on many other sites and have prior moderation experience. I was the admin of a fairly active PS3 clan containing over 300 users. I've been through the good and bad times of moderating. During this time as an Admin I had to personally deal with a lot of 'drama' with other moderators splitting the clan and taking some members. I've always dealt with problems head on. I believe that problems need to be resolved in the open and honestly. I share this experience with you to let you know that I'm not someone who takes moderation lightly. I know the toll it can take upon relationships and how you have to prioritize the health of the sub/site over others. Even if that is unfortunate.  On a lighter note I was born and raised in America and have a prettyy good grasp of the language (although my spelling is atrocious). My timezone is PST and I'm up from 8 am to midnight most days. Weekends and such are usually when those hours vary a lot more. But Monday - Friday those are the times that I am available for much of the day.      Although I'm not a frequent commenter, I do understand what it means to be a moderator and hope to be given the opportunity to assist wherever I can.

My name is Brandon. I'm from that little place down under called Australia. Although we are quite remote, we have a rather large CS audience, especially on the more competitive side of things.  Been playing competitive FPS (COD/BF included) for around 3-4 years, and have been playing CS:GO since August 2013. My interest in CS increased dramatically when I saw Katowice.   I didn't fully understand the scale of the CS professional scene at the time, so it was quite a shock to see all this hype around the game. Ever since I have been hooked to CS.  Around 8 months ago I discovered the Global Offensive sub reddit. I always knew it existed, but I didn't know it had such a thriving community, filled with people who genuinely want to share their experiences/hardships in this game and want to help fix it and improve it. Within a few months I created my account and have been reading and checking it hourly (when I am home or at work).  I am very interested in potentially being able to moderate the forums and filter out any bad behaviour or what ever else is required of me. I consider myself to be kind and easily approachable, and I have a good understand of the game mechanics and the competitive/professional CS scene.  As I have only been around for 12 or so months in the CS scene, I might not know as much about CS as someone with 3 years plus under their belt, but my knowledge of the game is increasing, as is my interest in other aspects of the game, including this sub reddit and trading/betting.  Another aspect that could potentially be valuable to your team is that I'm an active member on a competitive gaming website in Australia called CyberGamer. Basically the entire competitive scene for Australia is ran through this site with payed and free ladders/leagues. I know most of the  community and could very easily promote /r/GlobalOffensive and fill in the Australian community on information, events or updates they may be missing out on.  Cheers for your time and thanks for the effort you put in. Its much appreciated!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/swagtomato/	UTC+11

I'm interested in being mod because I have a deep passion for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and very interested in nurturing the growth of the sub-reddit and in-turn the growth of the game itself. I started this game around 2 years ago and have grown to love it since (Moving up the ranks to a mostly stable SMFC). I have not been very active in commenting and such due to me being mostly a lurker on this sub-reddit, but I have always checked the reddit page once or twice per day to see whats new in the CS world.  I am mostly online on steam around 4-7 hours per day and can easily keep up with the reddit posts and to moderate them at a good rate.  I feel as though I have a very advanced knowledge of the competitive scene. I always have HLTV on a 20 minute refresh and also enjoy watching competitive matches live or casted at a later date. If you give me a player I could easily tell you all that I know of that person.  I currently have no programming knowledge but I plan to learn in the near future.  Some reasons I feel you should consider me:  I reside in the SEA region where I think that you may have a shortage of mods. Due to the shortage of mods in this region you are not able to keep up with postings at times where it is night for you guys. With me you could all peacefully sleep while I do all the hardwork :P  I feel as though I am a kind/helpful person. Usually when I see a problem either on Steam or someplace on the internet, I usually go out of my way to help that person fix their problem. With these traits of mine I feel I can help nurture the growth of the sub-reddit.  If there is a event planned in SEA I could easily manage that due to location.  Well, that was my basic introduction for myself and reasons for me to be in the Mod Team. I really hope you can consider me to be one that could join your ranks.   Thanks, Dobix (Mike)   Note: My steam name is currently different from my Reddit username, if you would like me to change it, I can easily do that.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/dobixtrade	GMT+7

I'm quite certain there's going to be someone else more qualified for the position but I happen to have have loads of time on my hand and literally don't have anything to lose by submitting this application.  I'm a leader, I like to tell people they're wrong - this summarizes me quite well even though I'm not very proud of it. My experience as a leader go way back to when I started playing RuneScape. Up until last year, I was the leader for a one of the biggest PKing-clans which required a bit too much management, hence why I quit. Other than that, I have a lot of experience in Sony Vegas, Photoshop, Lightroom and TeamSpeak 3.   I'm confident you will find someone else but I'm happy to help should the opportunity come about.	https://steamcommunity.com/id/frandez	GMT+1

I'm KidDeath, but feel free to call me by my real name (Trevor). I have messed around with coding, but I never really finish any of the courses I've taken so I really didn't think I should mention any that I "know". I personally think that I can be a good addition since I do have experiences with mod, and admin responsibilities (2+ years in gaming communities). But in regards to what times I'm available, I'm really free most of the time through out the day (2pm-4am). Hope you guys really consider me for the position. Also I do work in a Quality Assurance position in the community I'm currently in. Basically what I do for that job is kinda process people into the community, and help people with general questions, and it sometimes gets overwhelmed with people whether needing help, or just trolling. I also have knowledge of how competitive scenes works from my experience running UGC teams for tf2(don't know if csgo works the same way or not thouhg:/).

I am 14 - I run by a few aliases, such as "FragginZzz, jdh-, and hNdle" - I live in the Midwest (a bit north of Chicago) and I've been playing Counter Strike ever since I had the PC to do so (Winter of 2013).  On average, I'm available 7ish hours on weekdays (2:30 CST - 10:00 CST), and I typically am on Reddit quite a bit during school.  My moderating experience is a bit lackluster, to say the least.

I was an Eagle Scout and so was my brother, being helpful and kind runs within me very easily, and only where arguments thrive and are accepted do I go away from that. I am 27 years old and have played counter strike since it came out in 1999. Forums are easy for me as knowledge and respect for gaming has grown since taking a break from college 18 months ago, so when it comes to looking over everything on the forums I don't miss what I see and I like all of it. As I said before I might go into journalism thus writing is a pleasure flows like the electricity shows the millions upon millions of pixels on my desk. I live on the coast in California which means my time zone is great for gaming in NA. I have been a chatter online always and in march of 2014 I started getting on twitch often helping fellows chatters, there I realized I'd like to use my knowledge of cs and my daily twitter/hltv/pro stream knowledge I had especially after attempting a csgo competitive team and I made it a point to notice all the knowledge the streamers, pros, and gamers alike, that put out on the news that a lot of which gave me big stories nobody talks about but help in the long run. I have even been called an insider of pro teams as my knowledge seems so impressive (you’d be amazed how much you know if you listen to every interview ESEA, thoorin, and HLTV provide). Not as much on the news this past fall but I will pick that up again soon. As I'm trying to start a youtube channel with all these stories and plays that nobody makes vods of (which are quite a few) if I am able to recruit fellow interested soldiers on the war of comprehensive knowledge of the csgo scene. I was thinking of this program I could use as well for covering more pro matches without as much man power needed (there is a secret program to it and I'm not telling you my golden egg :D). I am on everyday and I read Reddit all the time and recently have been helping out the new threads posts between me and the few other redditors there as it seems that at times I'm battling who gets to answer for everyone's Q's. At first I was hungry for every game possible with the list of friends on now but with the youtube channel and stuff my competitive gaming is limited to my friends that are serious as well and not as much solo queue and fielding new friends as much. Bonus points: I am really good at making videos for smokes and such, I even had one pro steal my instructions for a smoke toss (pretty narrow chances he decided to make a math solving phrase for his smoke as well, thanks Netcodeguides.com). I'm still not sure if he got it from a friend who saw my video or what but he literally copies the phrases I used in my video (and yes through the social grapevine there is a possibility my friends just gave it to his friend etc.) When I had a team, that was actually very successful roster wise (all im one went main and one into invite but team died before entry, while the original team died in intermediate possibly from a friend leaving for a high end team). My leave was due result of moving to the nearest college for my major and had no internet for 2 years at my place of residence then. I learned to run all the commands for servers/modifying stuff when making videos or researching maps for competitive play (wall bangs, tactics, next gen nade tosses, and at the time running lo3.) I play with people I know somewhat so I don't like community night and stuff. I want to learn how to code and other html stuff so I will do that some soon. I was told there was an app for mods coming so I assume he meant sign up when it comes out and I immediately went to commenting on all threads since then so I hope you notice that. I am a favorite or twitch and I mod for Dazed as he said to his stream “Lupin Best Mod Ever” (A couple times I literally spent all +12hours of his stream at full capacity controlling and interacting with the stream).	http://steamcommunity.com/id/LupinMay	GMT-8

This is an account I originally made to post to /r/polandball but it turned out to be the one I use regularly nowadays (prior to this I had two different reddit accounts I will not disclose, but I started using reddit in 2010). I'm a highschool student currently studying in Turkey, however I have been admitted to the University of Amsterdam to start in the next academic year of 2014-2015.  I started playing Counter-Strike casually in around 2007, and kept going for a while but never to better myself. A few months ago I bought CS:GO and I was absolutely hooked, and that's how I started following the reddit community as well.  The reason I'm applying for this position is not specifically for moderating the community, but more to fill out the vacancy for the programmer opening. While my preferred language is Java, I've been working on web development frameworks. Node.JS was one I've been working with for a while and even though my work has not gone further away from a blogging system, I still believe that I'm proficient enough with both JS and the Node API. I have experiences with database management and API design. On top of these, I'm also good at both styling and writing pages in HTML and CSS. Looking at the programming background you are searching, I believe you guys are trying to form a new website or service for the community.  I'm not really sure how I can sell my programming abilities but I'm willing to program challenges or tasks if they are going to help my application.  Along with these, I have an IELTS result of 8.5; with subscores of 9 from reading, 8.5 from listening, 8.5 from speaking, and 7 from writing.  I realise that I'm not necessarily in the desired timezone, and also probably unfit to moderate a community due to my age--but I believe that I can put my programming skills out there for you guys' disposal.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/slimdebonair/	GMT+2

If there's a good active discussion, or if I can start a constructive conversation, I try to.  No previous moderation experience on Reddit, I've done the whole thing on other private boards though. I consider something like this to be a small unnoticed by the community way of returning the favour of good content, going through the reported and filtering spam, all the usual stuff. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquid_flux/	GMT+0

I've been applying to medical school this cycle and have interviewed at a few schools so far, so that's my long-term career goal. Though I don't get to play CS:GO as much during the semester, I follow the pro-scene extensively and am pretty much always on reddit. I usually don't post as much because I don't feel like I have much to contribute, but obviously if I was a moderator I would do it where appropriate.  As an additional note, I do have some prior experience with this. I used to be an admin for a small TF2 community called Refuge Gamers back when I was in high school (so 4-5 years ago). I stopped when I decided to pursue that game competitively, but I am familiar with all of the core competencies that these positions usually involve!   As for why I'm applying to this - well, as I mentioned before, I am always on this subreddit and constantly follow the pro scene. I figured that this would be a great way to give back to this community and help out while still doing what I already do (plus, I'm familiar with it to some extent), so I thought it would be a great fit!

I am from England studying in university doing mechanical engineering. Just started on this and it will be 4+ year course, I have a lot of time on my hands at the moment so can do anything. I am willing to learn programming if needed, and willing to do anything else. I know quite a lot about csgo and the source engine, I also frequently go on the csworkshop subreddit and others related. If you see I don't comment much on topics it would be because on that topic I don't think my input is needed. If it is a question and I know the answer I would help as soon as I can. Be playing csgo since last December and started going on this subreddit around March.   I am very into competitive scene, (not playing, watching) I know all members and teams for tier 1 teams and trying to get used to all the frequent roster changes in tier 2 teams.   I am learning hammer at the moment and improving skins on everything csgo. I started playing counter strike in source and then playing a lot of global offensive.   One aspect I would like to say is I play on Mac and PC (mainly of, works better) but play on the go with laptop plus my PC doubles as hackintosh.   I hope to hear from you soon, Thank you for reading.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKAntoniou	GMT+0

Now I know that moderating is volunteer work but I have job and family to take care of so even though I will do the regular mod duties I might not be able to give my 100% with it as my time is valuable and I'd rather work for something that can earn me $, hence the affiliate proposal. So if you're interested in someone with programming and business knowledge with a bit of marketing experience, count me in.   	http://steamcommunity.com/id/mops4	GMT-5

I´ve been playing CS:GO for almost a year now, and quickly became interested in reading what other people thought about the game. About 9 months ago, I found this very sub, and since then I started using reddit. I was never really active in terms of writing, but always made sure to be up to date on what was happening in CS:GO, E-Sports, Majors, etc. I am typically online about 7 hours a day, including being online on mobile devices even more. During the Holidays, I am available about 12-14 hours a day. I have not made any significant efforts in programming, exept for a basic Java school course, in which we also learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I remember most of it, and I am confident I could read myself up-to-date in programming really quickly. Furthermore, I am willing to take on anyone  in an 1vs1 quickscope battle, for i am the master of the 420 blaze it noscope (using nova).   Another thing i could add to my list of qualities is my possession of multiple monitors, so I can monitor the sub more easily while also pwning silver scrubs at the same time (You can call them that when you are Gold 1, right? :P )	http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirBlubbalot	GMT+1

On a serious note, I like to think what makes me a good choice is how my interests are quite different than most CS players. I'm big on the modding scene, I love custom maps and participating in community events. I really enjoy some of the things going around here that the mods have allowed, like surveys about people's hardware, allowing self promotion of custom content, and typically taking a hands off approach and letting the community grow and steer itself.   I want this position for the power of it, it is a very lucrative position I can use to leverage what I feel are the best aspects of the community. It takes one bad mod to turn off people from a subreddit, I assure you I have my ego in check, and I severely dislike having to intervene but will if I need to.   145k subs as it stands, that is a monstrous community to look after, only a few places on the internet can match the sheer volume of what you manage. You can trust me to not be an idiot, and to remain unseen. I fully understand what you are asking of me, and I'm not going to blow it, and I'll tell you why:  I want to work at Valve, I always have. The last 10 years of my life I've worked towards becoming skilled enough to apply and stand a chance. Being a moderator of this sub is a point of leverage I can use alongside my portfolio www.zastels.wordpress.com (Seriously check it out). I've been dedicated not just to Counter-Strike most of my life, but everything Valve. If you give me this opportunity, I'm going to use it, and I'm going to work hard to keep it.  I request a more formal meeting, let's find out who one another are a bit better.   Regards,  Michael "zastels" Mayea	http://steamcommunity.com/id/zastels/	GMT-5

I already do, for about $3 an hour.  But seriously, I'm a high school student in Australia (GMT+9:30) that wanted to become a moderator of /r/randomactsofcsgo, however as that didn't go to plan I went back to normal reddit and csgo, following the scene and upvoting posts.   I am somewhat experienced and I have some basic knowledge of HTML.  Honestly, this position doens't seem too intensive   "For the first fifteen days, you'll have "posts permission" (remove/approve buttons, etc.). For the latter fifteen days, you'll also get "mail" permission (which lets you read and respond to modmail). At the end of the trial period, we'll evaluate how you did, ask what you thought of it, etc."  I believe I could handle that smoothly, if I cannot answer something from the modmail I will leave it for another moderator who hopefully knows the answer.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/theantiarcher	GMT+9:30

CS:GO is my main game, and I'm currently ranked as MG2. I also play other games like Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, FTL, Kerbal Space, etc.  I've been a sub to /r/GlobalOffensive for about a year now, but am more of a lurker than anything else, though I'm trying to change that.  About the above 'Well spoken, takes care in writing responses': Due to my time as a moderator on other sites, I'm pretty experienced in dealing with people that are upset/don't understand why something was taken down or isn't allowed. Having been in that situation, I try to be as clear and explanatory as possible in order to help the person not make the same mistake/break the same rule.

My name is Nathan. I have played many online games in multiple communities throughout the years, CS:GO being my most recent. Throughout my experience, I think my GTA:SA (MTA:SA) gaming experience would be the most valuable for me to explain first. I joined a GTA community as I was recommended by a friend and from my first few hours I joined a support chat and just took it all in for my own experience. I learnt a lot and I decided to help myself. Before I knew it, I was constantly in that chat helping people. I got offered a supporter position and I took it with great pleasure. I got offered staff position and I moved up ranks. I was staff on this server for around a year until I had an issue with the owner and I left (though he stated I was "kicked"). Throughout my time, I learnt a lot of things. If I remember correctly, the peak of this server when I was staff was around 1,200 players. The main one I learnt I believe was not to jump to conclusions. Always take your time and make sure you make the right decision. Think about it from different directions and how it would impact the user. I know, that as a figure in authority people will come to you more than they would any other user, so treating users respectfully who have queries is a MUST. No doubt about it. If you make the user satisfied, then the more you'll be respected by the community. I know, that on the GTA:SA server I was staff; people did not care about their reputation. They were punishing players all over and not caring; which is wrong. Communities should not think that figures in authority do not care and just do their "job"/"role". More of my customer service experience was a few years back when me and my friend started a small "business" where we bought dedicated servers and created KVM VPS' out of it and sold them on. This was very satisfying although it was very stressful. I was satisfying because we were helping people and making them happy with the services and support that we provided, however stressful because the constant managing of the servers. Constantly modifying the firewalls, checking security etc.   You asked about my programming (etc) experience, so let me explain how I got into programming. I got interested in programming when I was younger when I joined a forum which developed a game, but there was not many good, decent CMS' around. I already had a basic knowledge of HTML but I decided to try and create a CMS system. I partnered with a friend who knew CSS well and we created a GitHub repository and started developing a CMS. The CMS was coded in PHP, which is my most frequent language (I'm pretty much doing it daily). I mentioned jQuery and Javascript, but I think jQuery would be more of use since it is a Javascript library. When we were making that CMS, I did tweaks and we kind of heavily modified with jQuery and jQuery UI. From simple things like displaying errors if fields are not correct to profiles with widgets.  Python is my main desktop language. I use this to automate things basically, although I have written "scrapers" (mostly using BeautifulSoup 4) to scrape various pieces of detail from web pages.  Since a young age I was interesting in developing/programming and I have tried to pursue that. I'm always willing to learn or create something as long as I have an idea what to create, my imagination sucks unfortunately.   I mentioned Linux because I actively use Linux. Linux is my primary operating system which I am running the distro Arch (you can see screenshots in my topic in /r/UnixPorn). I do have Windows 7 as a dual boot but is basically for gaming.   I did select active on Reddit; although it may not look like I am active, I lurk. I'm actually only daily looking at my front page, from new, to hot, to rising. Usually, if I feel the need I have to comment I will do so. But usually, since Reddit is a large community what I have needed to say has already been said by someone else - thus meaning I would just be repeating other people which would be absolutely useless.  If you have any questions or concerns, please message me on Reddit or Steam. I would gladly answer you.  Thank you.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nathlul/	UTC+0

I am 27 years old and I live in Birmignham. My "real world" job is a recording engineer (music) and I work out of my own studio in the city center. As I work for myself I usually leave a lot of time to play CS and browse the forums (I even have CSGO on my studio Mac just incase lol). I have /r/globaloffencive as my home page and check it a a minimum of every hour. I sometimes have a little look at HLTV.org but i have learnt it is a lot more toxic and immature over there and I have found r/global offencive is the place to be in terms of getting CSGO info.  On a personal level, I enjoy games, music, snowboarding and my car! I'm a big music lover and petrol head basically :)  I would describe myself as a good person, I look for good in people and don't immeditatly judge. I feel I would be a good moderator, specially on a subreddit that hands down is my favorite. I'm a quick learner and can adapt to different workstyles to fit with the way you guys will be working.   Thank you for this opportunity, I look forward to hearing back from you guys. :)  p.s. as for programming language, that is totally not my world but I used to set up forums on my friends webspace that were PHP and required Day 1 knowledge, so, there's that.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/megaedd/	GMT+0

I've been in the CS:GO scene for about 9 months, and I cannot stop my fascination with the community and the competitive scene as a whole. I started off playing other non-steam games, then came to Global Offensive recently, as I said. I play a group of friends in a group named "EpiliN", but for a few reasons, the game is starting to become a little unenjoyable playing non-stop. Therefore, I think something like this might cut my time on CS:GO a bit, because when I play, I usually burn myself out, if you know what I mean. :P  I'm a squeaker. But, I am mature, and I do know my limits. I don't throw hissy-fits, I am normally calm and can attribute in any way possible.  As though it may matter, I am ranked at Gold Nova Master in CS:GO and I am familiar with the competitive/pro-scene of CS:GO. I am extremely active as well, seeing as though I play whenever I get the chance.  I do not have any coding history except for when I use to develop plugins for a Minecraft server with Eclipse and C++, it is a bit different the coding you may think.  If you have any other questions, I can jump in a teamspeak, or you can add me on skype @tjloppeteamvg4life. Thanks for this opportunity to help out the CS:GO community a bit!  EDIT: Also, since this is a *reddit* moderator application, I forgot to explain my experience with reddit! :P I have been using reddit for almost 2 years now with several different accounts, and I know how to work it regularly. I have also been moderator on a reddit for something unrelative, but it died down and eventually I got caught up with other stuff. If I got the chance to do this, I would definitely be active and help to the best of my abilities. I'm *seriously* willing to be dedicated and I feel like this would help me as much as it would help you. :)  Thanks, - TJ.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjloppesmells	UTC-5

I like to pride my self in being able to analyze situations and determine what is happening and see to the best outcome for the issue problem or task.  I am going to be upfront and say I am by no means the best coder, I however can help with issues and problems and I have experience with the following languages through my IT degree.  My main interest in IT tends to lean towards user experience and UI issues along with psychology. Often when a new piece of software or a UI update happens this pisses a whole bunch of people off and so my job/s within past projects was to advise on what the best course of action is for UI and how a program handles. I also was tasked with making sure people actually liked what was being created and reiterating to the programmers and UI designers, this is for the client and people, not for you :P .  in short I have an interest in being a moderator and I hope I can be of some assistance in the future.

I have a few years of experience as a moderator, web dev and (now ex-)partial owner of OwnedCore.com which is a website focused on MMO Exploits, bots hacks and guides. I will immediately state that I would never use or condone the usage of hacks in a game but this is a community I joined years ago and I've fallen in love with the people there.

My name is Diogo, I'm from Brazil. I fell in love with CSGO after seeing it @ EMS One Katowice and since then, I have been a major fan of anything CS related. I played a bit of 1.6 when it was still really popular here in Brazil, but I was 10 or so years old so I didn't really make a name for myself, obviously.  Things you might be interested in knowing: I am a CSGO mapper currently developing a major project in Hammer, it is nowhere near completion though, so I really can't show anything yet. You might also wonder why I don't have much karma, or any major comments yet; it is simply because I like to keep my mouth shut unless I have something good to contribute to a discussion. That doesn't really go well with how reddit works, but I'm online pretty much every day, staying online for about 10 hours or so after I get home. For reference, that's from 2-3 PM  to 11-12 PM BRST.  The programming experience question really doesn't reflect my current stand on it, in fact I am looking forward to studying computer engineering when I get to college, which will (hopefully) be in just over a year. That would involve most of the basic languages.  I would really enjoy being a moderator of such a growing community of what is probably my favorite game of all time, and I really hope you guys over at the mod team consider me for the job.  Sincerely, dada38  EDIT: I cannot participate in any events as my area doesn't have any of them (that I have seen).	http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyareyouevenlookingatthis	GMT-3

Though I tend to lurk, I want to give back to this community because I find the atmosphere of the subreddit to be really enjoyable. I try to follow the pro-scene as much as I can but not as much as I want to though due to school. I have experience in python, visual basic and a little bit of html. I am willing to learn more coding languages though! I am a very patient person, and listen to others if they have any troubles. I will try to help them solve their problems to the very best of my abilities.  I hope that I get a chance to work with you.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/uk1000111	GMT+11

My name is William, and I am from New Orleans, Louisiana. I am currently 16 years old and attend private school in the suburban city of Metairie, and am decent in school. I started playing Counter-Strike:Global Offensive around seven (7) months ago following my decreasing interest in the online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) League of Legends (LoL). I played LoL previously for a full four (4) years and I was looking for something new, and CS:GO delivered. I have already devoted 267 hours and counting towards the game, as well as watched many youtubers and competitive matches. I did not check the box which said "Advanced knowledge of CS:GO and the competitive scene" because I don't think I'm completely in the loop. While I have been on /r/GO for the VAC banning scandals, and the Cloud9 back-to-back comebacks, I still think I have more to watch and learn. The same applies to the game, since I am still silver rank, which is kind of embarrassing to me because I have had it for so long. It isn't all too bad, though, because I find the game fun whether I win or lose. It is because of my passion to this game that I saw the Moderator Applications thread, and decided to apply. I am, as you can see from my reddit profile, moderating a few smaller subreddits, and I do have small CSS experience. I created the CSS and image flairs on /r/theescapists, as well as a small and simple concept (and image flairs) on /r/funrun. I think that /r/GO would be a great challenge to pick up, because in my daily life and work I try to push myself to accomplish better things, whether it's getting better at a game, working out, or schoolwork. I think that I could be a great addition to your current moderator team, and we could all learn something from it. Mostly me, though. Thank you moderators of /r/GO for this amazing opportunity. :)	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spellwright	UTC-6:00

My name is Gamertroid and I've recently been spending so much time on this game. This sub has been seriously helpful and entertaining to read and watch.  I'm usually available online from 11AM GMT-10PM GMT about everyday whether that means I'm doing it from mobile or desktop. I'm very active on Reddit and always try to be nice to others. I try to make my responses as fluent and comprehensive as possible in a concise, mature manner. I'm semi-fluent in HTML (Currently learning it) as well and would love to use this as a opportunity to put it to the test! I also moderate /r/TLoL but one of the main mods left so we've had to suspend the project. I have been trying my best to help everyone out on that sub and even was one of the main guys sorting out flairs and answering questions but right now it is pretty dead due to the whole thing being suspended.  I hope that this can be a chance for me to interact in the community more as you all sound really nice. Thanks for considering me as a candidate and I hope you mods get the right man for the job, /r/GlobalOffensive deserve it. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamertroid/	GMT+0

I don't often post on it though. I'm a mod on another subreddit (that never took off), and I mod two private subs (for myself/friends). I've been on the "Recruiting Committee" (Interviewing and keeping track of applicants) and the "Board of Directors" (Admins, basically) for a military simulation group.  I also didn't list any programming experience, but that's not entirely true. I am able to work with pre-existing code for some more basic languages rather easily (such as HTML or JavaScript), though making something from scratch or making something complex is outside of my skill range.

So where do I start without boring you.  I have been on the forum for a year or so but never thought of making an account. I had been active on many forums before reddit e.g  the old playstation forums, 4chan and anime forums(too many to name) helping the community's I was apart of.  I would like to become a moderator for the Global Offensive because to my knowledge there isn't any/many Oceanic moderators that could help the Oceanic CS scene. whether it's to do with Oceanic servers, AU/NZ Tournaments/LAN events, and maybe help host community events for us on the other side of the world.  I am patient and willing to help anyone who may ask for it. I will play  CS:GO for 10 hours straight with anyone to help them practice and laugh when we die a thousand times over.  My cons are that I have forgotten most if not all of my html knowledge but am willing to learn(have a flat mate that has got html experience, will ask him to teach me if accepted). I have no experience as redditor and as of writing this application I only now have made an account.  I hope this wasn't too long for you. Happy New Year  ~Z	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ikera	GMT+13

You may be thinking because I have a new Reddit account I couldn't have all of those "attributes." The reason why I think I am qualified is because I was a former moderator for a forum a while back. I dealt with rule breakers,ban appeals,rule enforcement...etc. All of which required me to be patient, to be kind and to be perfect in my grammar. I am constantly on the internet and quick to respond.I also have a bit of experience with HTML as I took a summer class for the language. Now, why? It is because I love Counter Strike, I want to be helpful among the community as it is one of the best communities to be apart of.	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056710880	GMT-8

My name is Diogo, mostly known as Volt or RubberComputer online. I'm from Portugal, I'm 16 years old and I love Source-Engine games. This includes CSGO, TF2, CSS and many more. I decided applying for mod because I love being helpful to people, plus I'm always on Reddit everytime I get on the computer, which is every single day. Whenever I log on my browser, first thing I do is check the CSGO subreddit for news, funny pictures and who's been VAC banned from the competitive scene. I guess you can say I'm  always available to help other people.  Also regarding the last question, I do know a bit of JavaScript ( only the basic though!)  Thanks for reading!

I found out about CS:GO at the start of 2014 and since then I have put thousands of hours into the game and following the competitive scene. /r/GlobalOffensive has been a large part of my growth in Counter Strike. I have been subbed to this subreddit for nearly a year, making sure I see every significant post. I love this subreddit and the community surrounding it, therefore i am very interested in helping our community as a mod.      While I am not a mod of any other subreddits, I believe I am qualified for the job in this case. I have been a Reddit user for a little over 2 years. I am on Reddit very often and I have a very good understanding of the sites workings and systems. Despite my lack of comment karma, I DO comment fairly frequently. :P I enjoy responding to posts and users in the community and discussing the game and current issues.       As far as my personal attributes go, I like to think that I am mature for my age. I can recognize my faults, one of them being my lack of patience at times. For the most part I'm a patient guy. For the most part I'm also a nice guy, however there are times when I am not so patient, and not so nice. (Having a reputation to uphold as a mod of /r/GlobalOffensive would certainly make me sure to keep my patience and kindness in check however, so I don't think it would be an issue.) I have experience as a tutor, teaching students and helping them grasp concepts. Most of those that I have tutored saw improvement and explained that I had a way of explaining things to make them understandable. I don't know if this would help as a mod, but it's worth mentioning.      I am online and on Reddit for most of the day. When I'm not playing CS:GO, I'm usually on the subreddit or at least at my computer, available on Steam. I am currently in my senior year of high school, but I will still be available when I start the next semester because I go to an online public school from the comfort of my own home :P I am online for most of the day, so availability should never be a problem.       Well, that pretty much sums me up. As you can tell, I am fluent in English. Thank you for your time and consideration. Despite the outcome of my application, I would like to thank you guys for keeping /r/GlobalOffensive up and running with quality content, because this subreddit is very important to me. Have a good day!   -DCpride26	http://steamcommunity.com/id/DCPride26/	GMT-6

I'm Sean, 24 and I live in England, UK. Currently I'm out of work, so the amount of free time I have is unlimited. Majority of my time is spent trading, which is something I really enjoy and its proven to be a nice source of income! As you could probably tell by my Reddit posting history, I'm active on /r/globaloffensivetrade, however I don't neglect /r/globaloffensive. I mainly lurk, rather than post here.  I think I'll be a good candidate to moderate /r/globaloffensive as I'm incredibly active, I enjoy helping others with issues and problems, mature, great English, knowledge and experience through online moderating (will explain in detail below).  Although its not entirely related to moderating a sub-reddit, however I thought its worthy of a mention. I was invited to become a Player Moderator in a very popular MMORPG called RuneScape back in 2010. Still to this day I have my Moderator status, although I have fell into inactivity (I now live and breathe CS:GO). With such a massive player base and a very small moderation team, its quite special to be one of the few on the game. The responsibilities I have aren't as much as the creators, but still enough to make a difference. I've proven to be a responsible and trustworthy individual, which I'm quite proud of. Not once have I abused any of the powers I have, and it will stay that way if successful in the application.   I hope I've made an impression and I look forward to hearing back from you.

I love playing competitive MM (reached MG2 yesterday!) since I am quite competitive especially among my friends. I also run a surf server (meister's Surf 4EVER - ask me for the IP; hosted in Singapore).  Furthermore, I love following the competitive CS scene, and my current favourite team would be LDLC.  I'm an active redditor (been on reddit since April 2013, but have been lurking before that) and I browse reddit (at least) once/twice everyday. My favourite subreddits are: /r/GlobalOffensive, /r/tf2, /r/dota2, /r/askreddit, /r/videos, /r/Singapore and /r/JusticePorn.   With that being said, I'm online (usually) from 11AM-1/2AM everyday now, unless I have things planned, like dinners.  Oh and I also love dogs.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/meisterino/	GMT+8

And I've been on this subreddit for almost 2 years as well. Although you probably won't find many post/comments on this subreddit since I lurk here most of the time. I do come here at least once a day to say up with the latest news in the community.  Even though I have little to no knowledge in coding, I just want to point out that I'm majoring in Management and minoring in Comp Sci, so i'll be picking up programming/coding sooner or later. I'll have no problem taking my time to learn the coding language if needed.  As for the competitive scene, I been following this game since dreamhack winter 2013. I wouldn't call myself an expert but I have a decent amount of knowledge in each and their players. I'm not the man to ask when it comes to betting but I'd like to think that I know my stuff.  I was recently promoted  as a moderator on r/GlobalOffensiveTrade so I think I can somewhat understand the amount of spam/pointless thread you guys are dealing with and I think I can make a decent dent in the work load.  Donno if this counts but on top of speak/write English fluently, I'm also fluent in Chinese and can read/speak a decent amount of Japanese.

I am very experience when it comes to FPS games and have been playing Counterstrike on and off since CSS however CSGO is one of the only games I play regularly anymore. I took game design in College thus giving me some experience with coding, and being able to add to discussions about video games with thought behind what was said.  For just over a year I was an admin for over 50 tf2 servers under Multiplays guidance, I was let go because I became more interested in CSGO and therefore I frequented TF2 less often.  I am 19 (20 in literally 9 days) I am fluent in English and always try to structure my sentences well (I am currently writing this at 3:40 am so I apologise for any spelling errors or grammar mistakes.  I am constantly striving to get better in CSGO and I am constantly checking the Subreddit to see if any new or important content was added to the "forum". I always watch the main live events and read any CSGO article that is published on the few major article outlets (PC Gamer, Kotaku and so on)  Thank you for reading my application, I look forward to the results.

I am a 16 year old male from Canberra, Australia who enjoys both playing CSGO/CS ect. and actively engaging and reading about the scene through various means (reddit included, obviously). I came across the sub quite a while ago but it wasn't until the last few months that I began to actively visit the subreddit itself. I am a kind, patient, outgoing, helpful and very active member of the community who enjoy talking to and helping others. I'd like to help the subreddit grow and believe that as a mod I'd be able to put in my full potential to help the people of the CSGO community.   I'd also like to take this time to discuss my previous work as a moderator. A few years ago I helped moderate a Minecraft server (lol amirite) which had a user-base of roughly 500 people. While it was Minecraft, the experience still helped me form an idea of how I should be acting while moderating and performing in a professional manner.

I live in northern California near the coast on an apple orchard. I play a lot of tennis and I teach ballroom dancing to kids in middle school and high school. Other than CS:GO I play a few different RTS games (with IRL friends mostly) and I really enjoy Arma. I've played GO since it's public beta on Steam a couple of years ago and have loved every minute of it! It was my first CS game. Over the past few years I've become more and more interested in competitive CS and I now watch most of the pro tournaments and occasionally will bet a skin or two if I'm feeling lucky. I also follow all the major teams (especially the NA ones) and keep up to date on any sort of roster changes or drama.   I started out reading /r/counterstrike right when I started playing GO when I was just lurking on reddit without an account, but after a few months I found out about /r/globaloffensive and made the switch since it was relevant to the game I was playing, even though it didn't have that many subscribers. I originally made my reddit account for /r/counterstrike and /r/globaloffensive but I now will occasionally use it outside of those subs. I check /r/globaloffensive many times per hour usually and I often leave /new up on one of my monitors along with a few other subs just so I can keep up to date.   I'm currently a part time sysadmin at an architecture firm, so I have a lot of experience helping people with computer issues and troubleshooting complex network related issues. I also have taken a series of computer science courses at our local community college in C++, Java and x86 Assembly and I've picked up R and Python over the past year for various projects and for some research I participated in at a local University with some undergrad students working under a computer science professor in conjunction with Oak Ridge National Laboratories and funded by the Department of Defense. We were working on optimizing the power consumption of super computing applications and ultimately over the coming years the project will focus on developing an efficient scheduler using a bin packing solution to schedule the applications across nodes. I can provide the research poster I made for a presentation about the project if that would be at all helpful. If necessary I could easily learn js/css or any other sort of web tool although that's not really my cup of tea; I'm much more interested in low level stuff like embedded systems. I'm also very knowledgeable about computer hardware and I've built many computers and I'm quite good at troubleshooting them.   I love helping new people that I meet in GO. I often add new players I encounter in casual and teach them basic stuff like xhair placement and general game tactics for fun and possibly play few games with them and give them tips. I've made some really good friends that way whom I keep in contact with outside of the game, and I've helped a lot of people  I've met in GO with real life problems and some pretty serious stuff.   Anyone who knows me will agree that I am very relaxed, patient, eloquent and always eager to help someone who needs it. I would love to take a more active role in /r/globaloffensive (I normally just read and don't often comment) and to help the CS:GO community grow and flourish. I've had no experience moderating subreddits, but I'm a very quick learner and I believe my lack of prior experience wouldn't be any hindrance. I would most likely have a few hours everyday to moderate the sub (although that would definitely vary depending on my schedule. I am a student and will be for a long time to come (finish high school then undergrad + grad). I will always prioritize my studies and offline commitments before reddit and video games and nothing will change that.   Thanks for your consideration and for creating such an amazing place for the CS:GO community to gather and discuss everything from new updates to pro scene drama.   P.S. Sorry for any unclear sentences or information, I just played 3 full sets of tennis and I'm exhausted. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/th3m4dh4tt3r	GMT-8

I am a 19 year old living in Sweden working in a restaurant. Trying to become a CS:GO professional. Ever since I got CS: Source which came with my favorite game HL2 I've always been interested in gaming communities. I gained a lot of experience being in one of the biggest CS:S communities named GECLAN. I gained even more knowledge in community managing when I became one of the managers for Unscrup Gamers. Proof: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/UnscrupGamers After I stumbled upon Reddit I found about the CS:GO subreddit. I think I found it when it had about 20 thousand subscribers. I've been glued to it ever since. I love the spirituality of its community, I check up on it every day, spend probably too much time on it and I don't think I will ever stop visiting the front page of CS:GO :) I would love being a part with the amazing modding team and be helping out moderating the activity which is growing every day! My weakness is probably I've never been a Reddit mod before which I hope is not a problem but I can assure you I am a fast learner. Thank you very much for reading!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeMi	GMT+1

That's not really the whole point of it, certainly, but yeah. Furthermore, I really enjoy CS and the CS:GO community: I don't comment often but every day I browse the subreddit and I could easily begin to comment regularly. I used to comment all the time on reddit but some other personal stuff limits me to more just browsing. It is easy for me to get back into that though. Anyways, I consider myself a joker so I'd probably bring an air of comedy to the table, if that's what you're interested in. I love to play CS:GO, and I love having fun and learning new things about people. I also love tooting my own horn. Toot toot. I enjoy rap music, dance music, I'm rather advanced in french (maybe that will come in handy? I don't know. I enjoy languages in general, and can manage to understand Spanish as well.) I also like long walks on the beach and unicorns. In that order, backwards is awful. I listen, usually, and can pick things up pretty quick. I've also tried to get into 3D printing so if you pick me I'll totally print you something cool. Good luck to you guys, I bet it'll be tough picking a new mod, and I honestly doubt I'll be the one. Hope you find the right candidates.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebeardaceisreal	UTC-5

I'll start off with a that I'm currently attending high school here in good 'ol Washington State, I'm a Junior and I'm taking 2 computer science classes (AP and Intro to CS). I've watched a bit of CS:GO comp, I'm getting more into it, but I mostly just play the game, I'm S4 right now, highest I've been is SE, so I'm not good by any stretch. I learn more every day though so I could get some "advanced" knowledge. As far as how often I'm online/reachable, it's pretty much all day everyday, especially if we're just talking about reddit. Weekends I'm obviously more available but I don't have any commitments besides school and friends on weekdays, and we mostly just play CS:GO/Other games anyways. I noticed you said only one (of your six) mods is interested in coding experience so I'll just leave that here...   So I don't have much experience with coding, about 4 months into my APCS/Java class and in Intro I've spent about a 3 weeks learning HTML/CSS. The most I've done in HTML/CSS can be seen here: http://afkreviews.com/20XX (loud/obnoxious/sound doesn't work in FF). I also took Video Game Programming 1 and 2 my Freshman year, 2 years ago. In VGP 2 I did a bit of C++ but never got past more than a MPG calculator. I'm SUPER open to learning, I love programming and learning new languages, later in Intro I might be learning Python, it's all up to how many people want to learn it (basically me and this other guy).	http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplypimp	GMT-8

What's up, mod team? My name is Adrian. I'm an 18 year old year from Stockholm, Sweden, who basically lives and breathes Counter-Strike. I could go on forever and talk about how much I play CSGO every day and how much I love the game, but since it's only a teeny bit relevant, I'll get to that later on.  Anyways, while I do like CS, it surprisingly isn't what takes up most of my time. I spend more or less as much time as I can learning about basically everything computer related. To be specific, though, I'd say my main area of expertise is computer hardware and network technology in general. I go to what you could call the Swedish equivalent to High School, where I study Computer & Network Science, and prepare for future work as either a Database Technician or just a regular ol' IT Technician. I'm not sure if it'll be of any use, but I am fully educated in Windows' AD systems, and I have a Comptia A+ certification.  Now that we've gotten what I do out of the way, let's talk some more about myself as a person. When I first got to the point of this application where I was supposed to choose the attributes that I think define me, I instantly thought to just check every attribute, which I quickly realized might not be the best thing. I thought that it might be a better choice to take a while to think about the things I'm not very good at. And as much as I love myself, it didn't take a whole lot of times to realize that I'm not perfect.  The three attributes that I decided to leave unchecked was, Patient, Kind and Frequent Commenter. I'll go throught each one of them separately explain why I left them unchecked.  *Patient  My patience has never really been the best. It's one of the biggest problems I've had during my internship as IT-Support for a large company filled with old people. I have absolutely no problem answering simple questions over and over again, but I can get a bit frustrated when having to explain simple problems multiple times to the same people, because they don't understand. Whenever it happens, though, I keep it to myself, and I would never be rude or act inappropriate because I secretly think the person is stupid. Something that often works is to think that the person you're helping has their own area of expertise, and that you shouldn't assume that everyone thinks that the same things is easy as you do.  Other than that small problem, I don't have really have any other issues with patience, except for when you have to hold an angle with the AWP for an entire round ;).  *Kind  By leaving this unchecked I don't mean that I'm an asshole in any way. When I'm helping someone with something I know a lot about, I try to keep my emotions completely out of it, and act as professional as possible, kind of like a robot. I always try to find the most effective solution to a problem, without letting my emotions affect my response.  I can definitely be polite towards the community though, and I'd treat them just like anyone else. :)  *Frequent Commenter  Off to the last attribute. There isn't really that much to say here. I simply prefer reading other peoples' opinions and thoughts over sharing my own. Therefore I lurk a lot. If there is something I'm really interested in, I won't hesitate to comment, though.  Now that we've gotten all that stuff out of the way, let's continue.  "Why should he become a moderator?" is probably a question you think of when deciding who the new mod should be. To keep the application as short as possible, I'll just write a quick summary about why I think I'd fit.  Basically, I'm a really happy guy, who absolutely loves CSGO and most of its' community, and want to do as much as possible to keep it clean and make it grow. I visit Reddit almost every single day, and I've done so since my friend introduced me to it around 3 years ago. So I basically know most things there is to know about it.  While I'm not the highest rank in CSGO myself (DMG), I do know a lot about the professional scene and how the game works. I've been following the competitive scene since late 2012, and I haven't missed a single big tournament.  Considering all I do is sit in front of a computer, being online won't be a problem at all. When I'm at home I have my computer, when I'm at school I have my own laptop that I use for every single class, and if I'm not at home I still always keep my phone with me. So except for the 6-7 hours of sleep I get every night, I'll be online.  I like to think that my English is very fluent and comprehensive, but I guess that does matter who you compare me to. You shouldn't have any probles understanding me, though.  That's basically all I have to say, I think. If it somehow increases my chances, I also really enjoy Snus and Comicbooks ;)  Thanks for taking your time to read all of this, whoever you might be. I hope I'll get to know you in the future! :)	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kejsaren	GMT+1

I am quite knowledgeable about competitive scene, I bet quite frequently on CsGo Lounge so I spend a good amount of time browsing /r/csgobetting.  I do not have any knowledge when it comes to programming because I am quite young and don't have much time to learn a language and don't find it "desirable" to learn more after I get home from High School. :p   I have only participated in a couple community events but I will become more active participant if I become a Mod!

However, I am mostly known for my online alias as 'Zedd1cus'  I grew up in the town of Vallejo, California. It was and still is to this day a very gang-infested area. So growing up, I never really went outside or played sports. I stayed at home and played lots of video games on an old Playstation 1 my mom brought home with the Crash Bandicoot game. I spent many hours playing it, and finally my brother bought me an Original Xbox in 2005. This was around the time the 360 got it's debut. I played lots of Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, and started playing many first person shooter games. In 2010 I got a Xbox 360 and got into Modern Warfare 2, and played a lot of that as well.   At this point, I've spent so many hours clocked into video games, and I regret not a single minute of it. They kept me entertained, and I really couldn't see myself doing much without them in my life. In early 2013, I met up with an old friend from Elementary who introduced me into PC gaming. I wasn't completely new to it, back in 2007-2008 I played a little of Pirates of the Caribbean online, which unfortunately ended in 2011.   In February of 2013 I built my first (and only) gaming PC, and I played a lot of Minecraft & Battlefield on it. I came across the Twitch website and saw a guy named Summit1g playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I first took a look and brushed it off because I thought "the graphics looks bad." I totally missed the point of the game was about the core of it, not the looks of it. After more and more friends of mine got the game, I decided I would play it. My friend who introduced me to PC gaming gifted me a Steam copy of CS:GO and I fell in love with the game as soon as I played it.  It took a while to get used to, I would have super high sensitivity and my accuracy was really bad, but I looked up CS:GO tips and came across this subreddit. I had never used reddit before, and was a little confused on how it worked, but I got the hang of it after a while. I decided to register and subscribe to /r/globaloffensive and from that day on I started improving my game. I looked at tips, optimized my game settings, got a better setup. I lobbied with good team mates and got out of Silver & Gold Nova rank. All thanks to this subreddit, I have become a better player.  I love browsing when I'm bored, and answering help threads & giving insight on all sorts of content that is uploaded to this subreddit. It's a great chance for members of the community to get together and have their voices & opinions be heard.  As a moderator I would want to preserve the ideals behind this subreddit and make sure that it is kept in top shape alongside the great moderation staff it currently has. I'm very glad this community is growing and I want to help out in the process.  I'm not going to ramble on about my upsides and downsides, but it is up for you to decide weather I have potential or not, either way I'll be a dedicated member of the subreddit and enjoy it just the same. Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely, Zedd1cus. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/zedd1cus	GMT-8

My name is Benjamin and I am a 23 year old student from Orange County, California. I am currently going to school part time and working full time with a job that allows me quite a bit of time to browse the internet. When I'm not working or going to school I often spend my time with CounterStrike-related activities such as trading, betting on and watching pro matches, playing matches myself, or just doing KZ. And of course browsing and interacting on this sub. Sometimes I even go outside. I like the beach, surfing, volleyball, and riding bikes. I also love going to local indie rock shows throughout Los Angeles and Orange County.  Now that you know a bit about me, I'd like to share why I believe I would be a good choice for this position. I enjoy spending time browsing /new and helping out with common questions or pointing people in the right direction. I feel I have a lot of objective knowledge about this game as well as personal opinions. Both of which are needed for this sub as a moderator. Working as a team is one of my strong points and I would make it my priority to keep the sub moving in the right direction by promoting the rules and guidelines. With 2,300 hours in this game and countless hours browsing this sub, I have acquired invaluable knowledge that can be used to further progress the status of this glorious sub. The moderator position is not something I seek as a symbol of status or power but as an opportunity to help out the sub and the current mods.   Thank you again and I look forward to hearing back from you.  Regards, Bluesteel  Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.  ~Sam Ewing 	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067325179/	UTC-8

Some background on me I have played games pretty seriously since around 2010 when I first started playing League of Legends, I was Diamond 1/Challenger(when it first came out) in League of Legends. I have followed the eSports scene of LoL since then and more recently followed the eSports scene of CSGO.  I think I would make a great addition to the moderators of globaloffensive because being in college means I am up and often procrastinating on work by sitting on reddit and browsing better ways to get out of silver! Studying Computer Science and having worked in freelance Web Development I think will allow me to really contribute to the community over at /r/globaloffensive.   I have not been terribly involved with the Counter Strike scene as I am just becoming more and more involved however I used to be a pretty big contributor to the early League of Legends scene. I was Diamond 1/Early Challenger in League of Legends so I have always been a big advocate of eSports.  I think with the combination of my love for eSports, my knowledge of software development and my passion for Counter Strike I would be a great moderator at /r/globaloffensive!  	http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxJaxSmacks/	GMT-6

Started out with Quake 2 and Soldier of Fortune and quickly moved on to games like CounterStrike and Battlefield.  CounterStrike has been one of my favorite series since about 2005-6 when I first started playing Source.  I've gotten about 2000 hours total racked up playing CounterStrike so I guess that's a good indicator of how big of a fan I am of the game. I've been following the competitive scene for a little bit now, I only started recently though so I'm not that well versed in past events.  I have high ambitions of becoming skilled enough to be a pro player but that will probably not happen given the amount of time and effort pros have put in to playing the game.   Since the other field under the programming experience field isn't really a good place to put what I know that isn't already listed, I felt like I should also explain it here.  I work with Linux/Ubuntu pretty frequently, not a daily user but I know my way in and out of it via Terminal and via GUI. I'm currently training as part of the CyberPatriot program run by the Air Force Association, in which I learn a lot about networking and more specifically, Cisco networking (Packet Tracer and Cisco's software interfaces). My teacher is certified with a CCNA and he currently is having a partner with a CCIE (pretty much the highest certification in the industry) teach me and others in my group.  I am also preparing to become Base SAS certified in the coming weeks, after which I will begin learning Java.  I've had small experiences with Apache, SVN, HTML, and SSH, and I'm pretty much willing to learn just about anything in my spare time if I'm not doing homework, playing CS:GO, or hopefully modding the subreddit.   Although I don't necessarily participate in Newbie Tuesday or Community Nights, I can probably start.  I don't really keep up on when the Community Nights happen so that's probably why I don't get around to showing up in them, but I think this is a good motivator.  Since I'm only DMG/LE level, I think there's a bit of information I could offer to newer players, even though I'm not that good myself.  Anything I can do to contribute is really all I'm looking for.  I'm on reddit pretty much every day, sometimes in the middle of class.  I don't really post that much, I usually just lurk around and maybe comment every now and then.  I'm not really good at artistic content creation but I think being a /r/GlobalOffensive moderator will be a good learning experience for me and may possibly be my chance to really give back to the community.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/phlexiglass/	GMT-5

I'm usually always on Reddit whenever I'm on the computer and if I were to see something that needed to be dealt with, I'd be on it so quick you won't even know that problem existed! :)       I have recently turned 14, and even though it is a young age compared to most of the users I meet on CS:GO, I handle dilemmas and conflicts/problems very maturely and do not give up until the conflict/problem at hand is resolved. If there is an important matter at hand, I spend time contributing to the discussion and always use proper English, and make sure that my response/reply does not incorporate any spelling and/or grammatical errors. I have had experience with being forum and online game moderators in the past, and I enjoyed it a lot. I love being able to help people and it makes me feel happy and warm on the inside when I am helping someone.       Often when someone is out of line (disrespectful towards other people, acting immaturely, breaking the rules, etc.) I would nicely, yet assertively approach and/or ask them to put a stop to their shenanigans (it would be a warning, and the seriousness of it would depend on the severity of their actions/offenses). If they persisted to continue their behaviour, I would let them off with another warning or potentially a temporary ban (yet again, depending on the severity of their actions). Of course I would make sure the proper punishment is put into play, and that they do not violate the rules again. I am a fair person and I stick to my word.        Additional Attributes: As mentioned in the above question(s), I have a pretty good knowledge of CS:GO, although there is always new things to be learned everyday. I am not too educated on the subject of the competitive scene (I'll be honest here), but I know a fair amount on how it functions and what happens within it.       I have basic knowledge of HTML (small amount of CSS) and JavaScript, but I definitely intend on and am open to extending my knowledge of programming languages and becoming fluent in many different programming and coding languages. I am open and willing to learning.      I have not participated in any Reddit community events, but I shall certainly participate in the future.       I promise that if I am given a chance to show you how I perform as a moderator, you will not be disappointed with your decision. I want to contribute as much as I can to making Reddit and the CS:GO community a better place! :)       If there is any need to contact me, you can of course do it through Reddit, or you could email me at: pengasaurus2@gmail.com! My Skype is pengasaurus2 as well. I'd like to thank the moderation team of /r/GlobalOffensive for giving me and many others the opportunity to apply for this position, and may everyone have the best of luck! :) Happy Holidays to you guys, as well as everyone else on Reddit.   ~nPrimo :)	http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengasaurus2	UTC-6

I'm aaa270700, and I'm from Singapore. I'd like to apply for the mod team, for many reasons. Firstly, I hope to be able to contribute back to the community that has taught me so many things. Furthermore, I also hope to be able to gain experience with moderation! Why should you pick me? Firstly, I will elaborate on the points mentioned of which I have ticked above. Although I am a fairly new redditor and do not post/comment much, I still do monitor certain subreddits (/r/GlobalOffensive inclusive) almost daily.   I do consider myself mature. I feel that maturity is a very important factor in any form of moderation, as immaturity can lead to circumstances which are lose-lose for any parties involved, and can lead to quarrels over petty arguments etc. Maturity is a quality of myself I feel that I do possess. While I do have fun when I am with very casual friends, I am able to control my behaviour to fit the environment I am in. I can demonstrate restraint in situations where I am under mental stress.   I am honestly not a very patient person, but I will be able to wait when I really need to, though I would hope that whatever I was waiting for would hurry up. I do consider myself helpful and kind, and will try to answer any questions that I have experience about, whenever someone else seeks for answers. I am also very thorough when I consider about something, be it  something trivial or something that requires deep thought, and I would be able to do the same wherever it may be required of me.   As you may be already be able to tell, I am fluent in the English Language and I rarely make grammatical or punctuational mistakes, or even spelling errors. I do not comment a lot, as I usually just read the OP to know what is going on, and also the comments if it might lead to a strong discussion. I have also been following the CS:GO Competitive Scene ever since ESL One Cologne, making note of top tier teams, or possibly uprising teams, as well as inconsistent teams.   I am often online, playing as soon as I have time to do so, normally from 7AM to 8PM during holidays, and from 3-8PM on school days, and 6AM-2PM on weekends.  I also have minimal experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript having learnt it in school.  I feel that I would be able to be a valuable asset in your team of moderators and that I would really be able to serve the community well, even if it means doing menial jobs such as deleting posts which are of poor quality.  I sincerely thank you for reading my application, and I hope you will thoroughly consider allowing myself to join your team to serve the community!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/aaa270700	GMT+8

I'm on the csgo subreddit daily. I've played cs for 10 years. 350 mm wins and around 1500 hours. I play it most days. I watch pros on twitch and am up to date with all of the latest cs news, it's definitely a passion of mine. If I was offered the responsibility of moderating the subreddit, I would do so with utmost respect for the rules, and never abuse the power given to me.

I have always thought /r/globaloffensive had great moderation and if I could be a part of the group I would be humbled. I have never acted as a moderator for any subreddit so though I would be new to it, I feel I am familiar enough with the site to want to and be able to moderate for my favorite subreddit.

My name is jackmike16 [on reddit, obviously] I am from Saudi Arabia. I am very fluent in English [self taught] and i have experience both in reddit and CSGO. I have a 10 year account on steam [Brother made it when i was young, used it ever since i was 7.] I have played 1.6 as a hobby for a while, before it went on steam. Then i bought it and barely played it, I however have a lot of hours on CSS [1000+] and i have 500 hours on go. I realize that this is un-important but i guess this is a way to introduce myself. I am very active on steam but through this week and the next i won't be because i have finals. I am very patient with people, i realize when to joke and when to be serious [I however might be immature when joking] Otherwise i am very mature. I sound very young but don't act like one. I can be very helpful to people [With game sense, pro scene etc] I am on steam most of the time [I'd say 10 hours a day] I can be calm in competitive unless i am having a bad day.    I can not say that i would be a helpful mod, but i can cut down on the shit-posting, circlejerking and the annoying comments. You can add me through steam if you have any questions or PM me on reddit.

I am an active member of the community although only post when I believe it is something of value or merit. I can see the importance of high quality moderation in any subreddit but more importantly in one with the incredible growth rates like /r/globaloffensive. In a community that has shown to be ripe for drama, which scales uncontrollably, I fully believe that I could work to moderate and curate activity to create a more coherent and community friendly subreddit.   In addition to this I would class myself as considerably knowledgeable about CS:GO, I write for esportsadvice.com as a news journalist for the site. This requires significant research and care but is a very small time commitment, as I only write 4 articles a month. As a result I would like to think that my standard of written English is sufficiently good to apply for a moderation position (although this application may have been hindered by the significant painkillers from chopping the end of my thumb off with an axe on Christmas day).     I love CS:GO and can see the unrivalled importance of such an active reddit community to the scene. To me /r/globaloffensive should continue to act as a conduit for discussion, content and a communication link with the pro scene/ content creators. As a result I would love to be part of the way forward in the community. Thank you for your time Joe	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125074500/	GMT+0

I have played Counter-Strike for approx 9 years, 7 on CSS and 2 on CSGO. I play for a competitive team called Control E-Sports.   I am well respected within the Australian Counter-Strike community, I am admin on unity (PUG service) and play CSGO for about 40 hours a week. I have also been apart of administrative teams within the game. I've hosted my own servers (surf, FFA DM, build wars) all in which have been popular. I owned my own server box to host these, so I am very experienced in setting up servers, installing mods, changing files and debugging problems. I set the server up from scratch, so although I don't have the best understanding of ubuntu, I do understand the core of it though. I also work fulltime in retail, in which I am a Duty Manager.  Counter-Strike is my life (well, at least half of it :D) I live, eat and breathe CS. I am always on reddit/hltv keeping up with the news, updates and random things we find. I watch a lot of youtube videos about the game, interesting points, demos and matches.  I have a youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/IoITrain) I haven't posted in a while, but I'm looking at getting into again, aswell as twitch.  I want to apply for moderator, as I truly love the game. I am on reddit a lot of the time and would love to help give back to the community.

Being shouted at, insulted, and generally getting caught up in whatever was going on in the server was what made it fun, and years later when CS:GO was announced and I'd talked to the community owners I'd known about launching servers for it,a few weeks later I remembered reddit and checked Hands had already founded the subreddit. I'd been lurking the counterstrike subreddit for a good year and honestly thought that a subreddit simply for CS:GO was unnecessary, and now /r/globaloffensive dwarfs every other CS subreddit put together and doubled...  Anyway, I've usually ended up in moderation/management roles in the past, since I've usually ended up on forums chatting with the people who would scream or kill me ingame. I've been moderator of two different forum communities, was offered a third moderator offer about a week ago in the CS:GO community I currently admin for, and at this point I think it's really hit home the kind of attitude a moderator needs to maintain to not start infighting, shitflinging or open up any avenues for misunderstandings.  I'm pretty sure I fit most of the criteria, I played CS:GO at an amateur level, keep up to date with the scene because a handful of my friends follow it as well, fit in the timezone (unless my geography is failing me...) though I could never attend the subreddit events due to the inordinate ping (300~). Though I lack proper programming experience, I've messed around in python/css/c++ but never really applied myself, and my HTML experience is fixing formatting/displays. At any rate, I'll make this concise so you can attend to other apps, and thanks for moderating one of my favourite subreddits.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/givemeasteampage	GMT+10

I am 19 and I pretty much visit /r/GlobalOffensive every day and refresh around every hour. I don't always look at on /r/GlobalOffensive/new posts but when I do I actively participate in posts etc. In saying this, I always look at the front page and pretty much click every single thread and link to see what's the current goings-on on /r/GlobalOffensive. If attention is paid close to my post history, I try not to spread wrongful information and always accept the truth when I am wrong.  I don't currently participate in the Community Events due to the timezone difference but I am always actively reading comments and the many videos that are posted that contain information about them. I don't have any previous experience in moderating a subreddit but I would love for my #1 passion to be the first and hopefully you will let me have that opportunity.  I have ticked that I have HTML/CSS experience but I will have to brush up on it and I am willing to learn even more if needed.

I really enjoy the whole gaming scene as a hobby, not just CS:GO, but currently my passion is CS:GO, and not necessarily to get better and be the best at competitive, but to have a great time with it and learn everything I can. I try to learn and teach what I know, and learn some more as I go, really. I spend a lot of time on Reddit, browsing because I have a desk job, and I spend a decent amount of that time on this Subreddit and Askreddit, trying my best to answer questions with meaningful answers. Or puns, whichever is funnier at the time. I have been a mod before, on a few subreddits, and a few forums, as well as voice servers, I don't like to admin abuse, and I like hearing out cases before I really make big decisions on things on a whim. It makes my personal life a little slow sometimes... I have no problem adding new people on steam and taking them into DM servers to show them some tricks about shooting, crosshair placement, or what it's like to get one-tapped around corners on Dust. I know my timezone is a little off on what you were asking for, but my hours are so messed up where I am anyway, I'm usually on during both Reddit rushes. I live in Texas, and I wake up at 11:30 PM to get to work by 2 AM and get off work at 10:30 AM, then sleep during the afternoon, so I am essentially always on in the middle of the night or the morning. Either way, have a great day, and thanks for taking the time to read my book. :D   P.S. I know my Steam name is The Fuck You Whale. There is a story behind that and it's not permanent, but until the guy understands that I am still the same Whale, he's getting the middle flipper.	http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/theriffles	GMT-6

A well experienced , mature , kind and polite mod is what you search for, that´s why i got attracted by the Post on r/csgo. I think it will be as fun as it was in the past with other , similar forum platforms, therefore i am writing this application. Before we start let me tell you this : I am totally against Cheating in Cs Go and in other games ! (You will know why i am mentioning this).  I start with by telling you something about my skills , experiences and my abilities which i could perform as a mod on /r/go . In the past , i used to be a moderator and Admin in a variety of forums and therefore i am experienced with the whole administration processes and the guidance of the the community to follow the rules. I learned to be polite and kind as well as helpful. Not every human being can be configured as you wish him/her to be, therefore there is a need to choose your words wisely without hurting anyone.That said , i hope you are interested to hear about my past in detail when we speak in the future.  I also learned programming in my school days. Even though i am still learning some programming languages , i am very well experienced with   Ecplise , Java itself and HTML. Yet i do not fear to learn more and more. About the Requirements : I could easily tell you that i fulfill the requirements , surely , but i think that you guys need to see it to certainly know what a person is capable of.So therefore i will skip this part , since i answered it already on the top part .  About my Reddit Activity & Cs / Cs:Go Experience : Even though i am new on Reddit (about 2 Months , maybe more or less) ,i am still not frightened to comment and tell my opinion and expression in a polite and logical way. I don´t fear to have discussions or disputes with other members of the community , but i get easily bored by people who try to be rude and insulting(or both).  My current Cs:Go Time is about 400 Hours , my rank is DMG and i am extremely well experienced in Cs Go. I used to play Css and cs 1.6 with my friends in my childhood and the jump on cs go was quite refreshing , since the time forced old games out and newer once toke the place of them.I am well informed about the competitive scene , since i am a big fan of the professional scene. So there will be nothing to stop me on commenting about these mentioned topics.  About my Steam profile and Past : By now , you may have noticed that i have 3 VAC(s) bans on record on my steam profile. I used to cheat in CoD and got quite experienced with cheats . I worked as an Anticheat mod in a famous underground game , called Alteriwnet and used to ban cheaters... ironic i know.  I frequently participate in the Overwatch beta , since my experience with cheating and hacking is very good , it is surprisingly easy to spot cheaters.And to clear out misunderstandings i am totally against Cheating in Cs Go and in other games !  Bonuses : -I am born in Germany , yet i speak 7 languages , and 4 of them fluently. (Including : German , English , Turkish , Iranian , Russian , Arabic (a bit), Azerbaijani) -I do not lack experience with situations which need physiological knowledge(How to behave to members who are young or from other cultures) -I am the friendliest German you will ever meet in the internet :)   Hope to hear from you soon,  Mayors	http://steamcommunity.com/id/mayors	UTC+1

I know you probably think that i'm lying and really have no experience when you see 'redditor for 3 months' but please trust me, i have another account that i have also been active on for about 15 months now.  Yes, i do not have any coding experience and i know this may ruin my chances, but i am very young and it is something that i look to study in the future.  I have wrote articles for my local newspaper on many occasions before and writing has certainly become one of my strong points :D. I am not known at all in this community and feel this would be a good opportunity for me to show that i have the ability, and get to know more people as well as to develop my slightly lacking csgo knowledge. As i just stated i am in no way someone that knows everything to know about csgo but i have been learning in my relatively short time playing this game so far.   Hope you take me into consideration and give me a chance to be a real part of this great subreddit.  Thanks, Will	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102704434/	GMT+10

I am gamer since ~2000, and i fell in love with  fps and rpg's mostly. Before CS:GO i was playing mostly CoD4 on semi-competitive level in Europe (won some online events, never lans because our team was scattered through whole Europe, and i was too young. After few years i finally decided to pick up CS, because all of my friends were playing 1.6, then GO. And i sinked into it very fast, because of community and amount of pro games (online leagues and lan events), but always as a viewer, never as a participant, i just like to watch and/or comment. personally i am a bass player in a stoner rock band, and i am working as a forklift driver. I think that i might suit mod job, because of time spent daily on reddit, my ability to moderate (i was moderator on Tibia forum once [don't judge me please :p] and on my CoD clans forum also) and my fluency in English. I never talk if i am not sure that what i am saying is true, and if i don't have anything to say, i stay quiet. I am not saying i am best candidate for moderator, yet i suppose i fit in that role well. best regards, /u/Jerem7	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000272836	GMT+1

So, I'm only 16. It's often not a good thing to be young, but if you say that it's not a problem, then it should be good. I've been playing CS for one year and a half now, at the beginning on Source and then I moved to GO. I'm good at computer science, and coding since I'm nince (my father taught me and I'll be for ever recognising to him for that). I live in a small island in Indian Ocean, and I'm very active in the CS GO scene there. We're not a lot, I would say max. 200 players here (for CS GO only). I'm one of the administrators of the two only servers we have, and I've always tried to be the most helpful and nice guy I could be, helping people with their performances and net problems, helping them to get good skins by trading, translating things like tutorials or being a translator / middleman when they trade. I'm also always looking forward to keep our servers as good as they can be, updating them as soon as an update is released, trying plugins during hours to get the best of the hardware we have (which is not the best we could get, though, so we have to optimize the things at their most). I'm also there if there are new players, since we are a very little and close community, I teach them the bases of CS (GO) and so they can have fun quick, since it's not always easy to be new, I know that if you're totally new in France for example, no one will help you to get started, and you'll maybe stay a noob forever. I'm also active in /r/randomactsofcsgo doing giveaways sometimes, when I have spare skins and time. So here was my application, I hope you'll like me, and if you don't, then, no problem, I'll still check /r/GlobalOffensive as frequently as possible. Have a good day !	http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoximor	UTC+4

I am playing CS for over a year now, with CS:GO being my first one, not counting the occasional CS:S at LAN parties. With a 2k hour background in Dota2 I was immediately hooked, because i love competitive multiplayer games. For the same reason I follow both competitive scenes on a daily basis and have some kind of twitch stream running most of the time.      I am a reddit addict for 3 years now (on my second account for private reasons) and mainly active on gaming subreddits. I also know my way around reddit formatting, which isn't always intuitive.     Most of my time commenting I either spend trying to be helpful or having a discussion. But comparing the actual time spent on reddit to my comment history I don't think I comment all that much.  As for my motivation to become a moderator, I am always interested in keeping the subreddits I frequent high quality, so me and others can enjoy visiting them. That's also why I started the (not yet) weekly discussion threads, which are currently on a halt, because I am visiting my family. I really enjoyed similar ones on /r/Dota2 for example and although I am not participating much in those, due to a lack of valuable information, I thought /r/GlobalOffensive could benefit from having a platform where others can share their thoughts.  My moderating experience is limited to a small German forum years ago and a rather big Dota2 twitch stream. but I am willing to learn how to effectively moderate a subreddit like this.   I hope this gives you a rough picture of me. If you have any further questions, I'd love to hear back from you.   Anyway keep up the good work and a Happy New Year full of awesome CS to all of you.  /u/me_so_pro	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047092446	GMT+1

Moderately actively follow the professional scene, have done so since 1.6. From Australia.  I have several years of gaming forum moderation experience (Au's largest CS:S community at the time) and definitely think a soft, considered touch is best 90% of the time. Certainly as a moderator I almost always take the approach that no response is better than a hastily written one that could mean the wrong thing.  I'm awesome at python (I mod /r/python and /r/phphelp). I can code up web things pretty easily as long as I don't need to photoshop a cool template beforehand.

I am mostly available online, however there are days when, due to university work, I might not be available for more than an hour. Similarly coursework could throw off schedules quite quickly, additionally I have a rather low bullshit tolerance.  However, what I can offer is a very disciplined approach, and react to any possible situations that might lead to flame wars quickly. I do think before I hand out bans/suspensions/delete posts, but will never directly talk to someone to answer why his post was deleted, I believe that is something the user has to figure out himself. Similarly I would work hard to make sure the community is nice and clean, and work towards removing the rank elitism which is still found around in the community (not referring to the "silver plays" threads which are all in good fun, but in general the bashing of lower ranked people and their attempts to get better).  I can't offer the largest amount of hours moderating, and I might make a mistake. However, I can offer brutal honesty and hard work at not only moderating, but making myself a better moderator.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogris	GMT+1

I live in Kansas, central standard time. I about always have Steam up and go on Reddit about every half hour, so I am often available. I am 14 right now, but on January 1st I will be 15 so I thought I should just put 15. I don't comment frequently on Reddit but I do know Reddit well. I don't comment much because, as they say, once something is on the internet, it stays there. I try to watch what I say, especially if I am typing it out before others see it. I do know a bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I am not too confident with it. I am definitely willing to learn though. I try to strive to listen to all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion, and I try to empathize with people and their issues. I have a lot of freetime on my hands so I am open to doing projects with the other moderators of the subreddit and even people of the subreddit.

I've preordered the game originally in 2012 only really got into playing around June of this year, however I know that isn't really the information being looked for here.  I can offer my programming experience and servers for gamenights, I can be a content moderator. I've setup automoderator on some subreddits, I moderate /r/uhccourtroom. My three servers are located in Nevada (1) and France (2) the French ones are dedicated, the Nevada one however is a VPS.  I'm willing to help out on the organisation side of things. I feel some things could be handled better (less posts about nerfing when there are so many of them as an example, I had an idea of a "What do you think should be nerfed and why?" Weekly thread for example) and there could be more moderators available at times (I mainly notice this in morning times around 7-10 UTC) and such.   To address why I have patience unticked above... I can be a patient guy, but on certain days I find my impatience is just too much, however I still try to remain calm and collected during discissions if someone disagrees with me, but it's enough of a thing that I feel I should leave that unchecked.  Hope you'll be able to accept me or even take that one idea onboard. Thanks guys.	http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/thedreamlord	GMT+0

I really enjoy this community, and I really believe in the future of Counter Strike. I didn't choose advanced knowledge of CSGO, but I want to get there. Counter Strike is a sport, one where you work with your team to accomplish a goal, and you're not going to let anything stop you, whether it's pre-nerf CZs or Olof and his autosniper.  Your mod team must be similar to that. You wade through the shit-posts, working with the others to make sure that all those who come to this subreddit think to themselves, "Wow these community isn't toxic" until it is far too late.  I'd really, really like to be a part of that team, and make sure that what is arguably one of the largest Counter Strike related blogs/news-sources/nerf-complaints to be the best that it can.

IRL, I am a corporate buyer for a chain of supermarkets, specializing in Asian import goods and am currently working on my MBA. I am also married and have a 17 month old son, so maturity will not be an issue with me. Also, I am Japanese so respect is a huge thing to me. One of my goals in this community is to fend off the BM attitude that many have developed in this game and to keep a respectful competitive atmosphere that I feel is missing in our game.

Unfortunately, I'm probably a bit rusty on both as I wasn't huge on it and I haven't done any programming for a little while.

I speak fluent English and I know my fair share of French, although not enough to completely write a full setence.   I have had previous administration experience before, mostly in game servers such as Mount & Blade: Warband as well as some of their most popular modifications: Persistent World and Napoleonic Wars. Although I was administrating in-game, this kind of administration also required me to moderate forum boards as well as the server logs.   Some of my other experience includes me working for various server hosting companies such as: ORPYO Game Servers and Beyond-Servers.com, which I also helped manage their website and help desk. The business I have recently been working with has been Xean Network which is a Youtube partnership network. For more information based on my previous work experience feel free to contact me, otherwise I'm only mentioning this to express how mature and patient you have to be while working on a help desk.  There's not much more to say apart from I have always wanted to do more for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive community, although there have been no suitable oppurtunites for me to take part in. I will also admit that I have had no experience in moderating a sub reddit but I am always open to any help available. My reddit account hasn't been active for a long time either, although I have been a long-time lurker of the sub reddit, I have just never felt the need to post anything.

I am Bence Kovács a 18-year-old player who likes to help the community in many ways.   2 years ago I started as a enthusiastic writer on a League of Legends fanpage (http://www.leagueoflegends.hu/). I wrote my own articles and translated news for our hungarian LoL community. Now, I am a coordinator of the magazine and we have a direct contact with the hungarian Riot Games workers. We organized 'viewing parties' for the 2014 World Championship final and each of them had 140+ participants. We watched the final matches together and as they told us everyone had a good time.  I have always been a Counter Strike fan. I played 1.6 for many years but when Global Offensive came out I felt like I want to do something for it. I want to be more than just a player. 5 months ago I joined the hungarian ESL CS:GO section as an admin (http://www.esl.eu/hu/admin_structure/#csgo). I guess I don't have to present ESL. We organize cups online and offline.   I know the hungarian esport scene well, and I read reddit every day to keep up with all the esport happenings in the world.  I am also a member of a campaign called 'Egymillióan a magyar esportért', it means 1 million people for the hungarian esport (https://esportmilla.hu/). We connect all esport games and the people in it (players, managers, sponsors etc..) to help the community grow.  I think those informations above says it all. I like to think myself as a kind and helpful guy, who do as much for the community as he can.  I'd like to mention that my english is not the best but I'm trying and I feel more comfortable writing in english than talking. Furthermore, I created my reddit profile for this application only, because I usually just read the posts and comments.  I am very active and spend most of my time online. Since I am a writer I know things about HTML but I don't have any coding experience. I'm sorry for that.  Thank you for reading my application and have a nice day!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyy/	GMT+1

I will keep this short and to the point as I'm sure you will be reading a ton of these.  My name is Shawn, I'm 28 and on reddit Alot, particularly r/globaloffensive and r/leagueoflegends. I honestly lurk most of the time, commenting occasionally and tossing a few up/down votes.  The main reason I'm applying is just to help out, I care about this community and am willing to help when opportunity arises. Honestly I tend to stay fairly quiet and just do what needs doing.  I'm honest, kind, and patient. I really don't let much of anything get to me, even personal attacks, espeically online I tend to just shake my head and laugh them off.  I have degree in Multimedia/Graphic design (although I admittedly don't use it much these days) and some experience with HTML and basic programming, mainly in adobe flash creating web games. More than willing to learn anything that would be required, I've actually been wanting to learn some more Web coding.  I'll end by letting you know what you should expect should you chose to give me a shot. - What gets asked gets done - Questions, I will probably have many. I tend to clarify / analyze everything before I act - No strong emotions one way or another, I almost never have knee jerk reactions to anything. - Willingness to do stuff! like I said I'm here all the time, love cs:go and care about this place. - Jokes!, I'm pretty funny sometimes, maybe... probably not... sorry I'll stop talking.  Either way thanks for reading and good luck guys, you seem to do a great job currently, keep it up!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/gridbro/	GMT-6

Regarding the information in the form, I'll clarify a bit of it. I didn't check the boxes for "kind", "experienced with reddit", or "advanced knowledge" because I wasn't sure I fit the criteria. For experience with reddit, I've never been a moderator. I've been on reddit for 3+ years, but I don't know that I'm experienced with its inner workings, etc. Advanced knowledge was similar -- I have a good working knowledge of the game and its mechanics, but the second part of the attribute description (the competitive scene) I only passively follow. I did make most of the informational posts for the majors, but I don't really follow the day-to-day or even week-to-week happenings. As for kind, it just seemed odd to check that box. I do think I'm helpful with new players and I try to handle things in a kind manner, but it just feels weird to call myself "kind."  I work as a Linux system administrator, concentrating on our company's websites (I administer the servers and sites of all of our corporation's subsidiary companies). The largest site receives about 10 hits per second; most others are around 1-3 hits per second. I deal with a lot of spam, malicious activity, and general maintenance of heavy-traffic sites. On top of that, I'm in charge of code changes to the site. That may not be directly relevant to moderating the subreddit, but it includes interaction with our developers and content authors. That is, I do a lot of support work. Many of our developers and authors are either from overseas or are outsourced contractors. Essentially, I talk with and help users everyday. It can range from policy/rule enforcement to simple requests for assistance, but I think it's relevant experience.  I'm also in the timezone requirement and I'm online a lot. While I don't log on to reddit much at work, other times I'm almost always online and checking the sub. I do also participate in the community nights and those are a lot of fun.  In short, I think I'm a pretty good fit for the mod team and I'd like to do it.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/fatbird3/	GMT-8

I've been using reddit actively for 5 months now, and I am enjoying it, I have never moderated a sub reddit, however I have moderated forums of gaming communities on Garry's Mod before, such as ZARPGaming, I've also been staff on there server for many months, which hopefully proves that I am calm, professional, and helpful at all times, I like helping whenever asked, and this felt like a chance for me to help out moderating this sub reddit as I am addicted to CS:GO and what not, If accepted I will try my best to keep this sub reddit as clean as possible and make sure its good looking at all times, although I do not comment frequently, I still lurk most of the times, I hope that is not a problem.	http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/blockedthepotato	GMT+3

I played a spin-off CS game called Combat Arms for 4 years, but later moved on to CS:GO.  I currently live in an area without an ISP, so I use my 4G phone to tether for internet. I only have 10GB a month on this phone, and gaming is possible for it, but only if I set my rate commands low to save on bandwidth when playing. I do have a 2nd phone with unlimited 3G data, so I am always on reddit with it, and am naturally active. I started college this year, so I chose this year to better myself and become a better person. I feel like being a mod here would help me with that, and have me help others too. When I started playing matchmaking at the nova level, I noticed the toxicity from players, ranging from teamkilling to  poor sportsmanship. I am really glad I got past the novas, but there is still those kinds of people in any rank, and on reddit. I wish to end this toxicity from the community. They say to be the change in wish to see in people, so I hope that applies here. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowace52	UTC-4

Even though I may be young, and this may sound somewhat arrogant, I think myself to be a very mature and honest individual so I can most likely solve social conflicts. On weekdays, I am usually offline until 3:30 PST because I would be at school, but I would be online until 12 PST. On Weekends I would be online through 9 am PST through the late hours of night depending on how I feel. I sadly do not have that much programming knowledge, only small bits of javascript that I have picked up from conversations with my friends that are in java classes as my interests are in professions such as Law, but I am a quick learner, so if necessary, I can pick up these skills.

My name is Richárd, and my nick is Ricsi.  I would like to apply to the ranks of the almighty r/GlobalOffensive moderators. First, I would like to introduce myself in a bit more detailed fashion, following that I will state my motivations for applying.  As I said above, my name is Richárd, I am from a small city in Hungary. I learn in a bilingual school, which means I learn most subjects in german, but I also learn english. I have a C1-level language exam in german, and sometime early spring I will get one for english as well. My hobby has been playing computer games since I was about 7 or 8 years old, this is where most of my english knowledge originates from. I started focusing on esports around 2010-2011 in LoL, then I jumped over to the Starcraft community in early 2013, and I follow the Counter Strike scene since late 2013. I would say my knowledge of the community and players to be better than average, but I lack information regarding oldschool players, like the now returning RpK. I think I started using reddit about a year and a half ago, I am not really sure. I would say I know most functions used in everyday redditing, but I am not an expert by any means. I would say my pros would be my knowledge of the current state of the community, the huge amount of time I currently have, my talent in learning new things, that are connected to the internet or computers in general, and my tenacity against trolls of any kind (I don't get upset by anything offensive really). My cons are my non-native english skills and my lack of patience against disorganised people in terms of usage of capital letters, dots etc.  I would like to apply to be a moderator on my favorite subreddit, because I have a lot of free time, and I would like to help the community instead of wasting all that time. A "job" like this would also force me to hone my english skills even more, which is always nice. Esports is my truest pashion since I learned about it, and doing whatever little I can do to make it better seems really good for me. Back on the Starcraft reddit, when they were looking for mods, they listed the downsides of being a mod, like having to look at spoilers and getting a ton of undeserved hate, but none of these would be a problem for me.   Thank you for reading my application, I hope to hear from you all soon!	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024218939/	GMT+1

I've always been heavily interested in anything related to Counter-Strike and the FPS in genre. I started when I was 3 years old and my dad got me a computer to play 1.6 on and have been playing ever since for 15 years and have followed the competitive scene for quite some time. As to why I'm sitting here applying for this position is due to the amount of low quality content I often see posted onto this particular subreddit. I'd love to be a part of the team that cleans up low quality material to keep the subreddit top notch and a pleasure to visit. Along with an itch to clean up the CSGO subreddit to the best of my ability, I have an absurd amount of experience administrating gamservers/voip servers along with moderating forums, twitch chats, and a couple of subreddits in the past.

I have been playing CSGO for a while now, but I now play less, due to my programming career becoming a bigger part of my life, but I still remain active on reddit, although we (Na`Vi) haven't been able to directly provide our content due to reddit's rules. I've been moderating forums and game-servers for a good while and I feel that becoming a moderator of /r/GlobalOffensive would be no different to what I have previously experienced.

I don't know where to begin. A lot of valid reasons came into mind when I read your post as to why I should be a mod here, and as I kept reading - I realized that you'd already mentioned many of them. Seeing how I have many points to cover - I'll just go ahead and let your list of 'traits' guide me.  I'm Dawn, 25 y/o, from Israel (turned 25 on Halloween, too bad it's an ordinary day here =[). Dawn is the English translation to my name. My name is spelled (and pronounced) with a letter that does not exist in the alphabet ("ha", but more like the Spanish pronunciation of it), so you can either call me Dawn, xzotic (been using that name since 2003 for anything internet-related), or ^_^ (have been using that one for a while now. A friend began calling me "arrows" because of the carets, and it kinda stuck, so yeah - either Dawn, xzotic or ^_^ (arrows)).  My English is more than fluent, and many American friends have told me that had I not told them - they would have never guessed I was not from the US (and that is after chatting with them for weeks/months). That being said, I was also told that Dawn is a female name over there, lol. But over here it's cool for both genders, so yeah....... D:   I'm not the type of guy to claim to have been playing CS for literally 9 years just because he's purchased the game 9 years ago, but I did start with CS:S, late 2005, and have been playing on and off ever since, until I finally quit, back in mid 2010. I've gotten to a point where the only thing I am willing to play is competitive 5V5, but our community was pretty much dead, and so I slowly gave up and 'retired'.   A few months into 2014 (April or so), a few friends linked me to some FPS game named S.K.I.L.L  and asked me to play with them. Playing that FPS has made me miss the best FPS I've known (CS) so bad, that I've decided to hop into my Steam account and talk to a few old friends about that 'newer version'. They'd told me CS:GO is thriving and I should indeed make a comeback, and so I did.  My CS and competitive scene knowledge in general is excellent and more than sufficient for the position. Obviously MM ranks don't reflect the exact picture nor disclose much, but they do paint a vague picture, so it might be worth mentioning that I've Solo Q'd my way up to nearly SMFC (was a win or a couple wins short), and it's pretty damn hard over here, because you often (and in my experience - TOO often) get matched up with many leavers/trolls and what not.  That is why I didn't mark the 'experienced with Reddit' box, as I feel that a few months isn't considered to be that long. I even made a post that was against the rules, just last week, but you should read the content as well - http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2q8td9/rglobaloffensive_steam_group_please_take_a_minute/ In my defense - I asked for upvotes for a selfpost just for visibility for the groups sake, but yeah - It'll obviously not happen again. As you can see - I was (and AM) willing to contribute to the community regardless of my position - as I have agreed to play along with what Jpon9 has suggested, only that I haven't gotten back to him yet because I haven't had the time to get the details down as I had planned (even today, I haven't slept because I'm trying to complete the assignments that are due tomorrow); I'm a Computer Science student (fresh year). This semester we are busy with C (and some of our home assignments are self-learning and Python exercises), and next semester will be JavaScript.   While I don't have time to play every single day (due to obvious reasons) - I make homework and assignments in front of my PC - and so I frequently browse Reddit. I do post, but not as often as I could, if needed. Reddit is a constant thing I always have time to, unlike, again - some other projects - so I'll say it upfront and be honest about it, but as I said,  I'll be always available.   I have a big sense of humor  and can be quite the troll - but I can separate and be serious when needed. that includes managing TS, making sure you don't get personal matters affect your judgment when facing an administrative decision, staying representative and formal when needed , etc.  The amount of time and effort I dedicate to details is beyond the roof, and that is a natural derivative of my perfectionism (hopefully it doesn't sound too pushy, but I just am, and it drives me crazy more than I would like to admit) - I have to do something as good as I possibly can, and that is why I tend to make "walls of text/ essays" for posts (as acquaintances and friends often call it), which leads me to give as much information as I possibly can whenever I make a post and/or try to explain myself/the point I am trying to get through. Here is the most recent example (if this very post isn't one): http://www.reddit.com/r/csgobetting/comments/2qnnhp/hey_guys_while_we_have_some_time_between_matches/cn81v7o   Anyways... I hope I haven't forgotten anything, but yeah... that's about it! That'd be really cool to get picked, seeing how I'll be able to mod a subreddit I really care about, for the game I like the most.  Sorry for the long post! Dawn // xzotic //^_^ 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/xzotic/	GMT+2

Hi! I'm Jordan, and I have played CS since source. I have multiple accounts , but this is the only I mainly play on.

I try to red every comment on posts in the subreddit just to gauge peoples opinions on the topic. I have not missed a minor tournament yet, and When I hear people asking questions about Counter Strike, I always answer to the best of my ability, and often direct people towards this subreddit.

When I am not playing the I spend a lot of time on the subreddit (as well as a few other CS:GO related subreddits) and watching pro matches. I haven’t posted a ton, but I am here lurking almost everyday. I understand how Reddit works and have been on here for over two years. What do I do when I am not playing CS:GO or on Reddit? Besides school, I am interested in computers and programming. I recently got a raspberry pi, and have been learning lots from that. I marked down all the coding languages/libraries/concepts that I have some experience with, but I would love to learn anything else that I would need to.   I feel that I am very mature and I think being part of the CS:GO and reddit communities has made me act even more mature. I have school from 8 to 3 most days, but I would be available intermittently throughout that time, as well as before and after that time. I could be able to be on much of time when I am not in school, because I do not have many other obligations to attend to. I feel that I could bring a lot to the already amazing mod team and I hope that you will consider me.

I am a born English speaker and am consequently fluent in it. Though it may not be a positive thing normally, I am very picky about minute details and I believe this is an extremely important thing in moderator, though up until I tend not to correct people as they may take it the wrong way. I am also a four-year user of this site and have great deal of knowledge on how it works.

I've ended up spending a lot of my free time browsing reddit, mostly reading gaming, sports, or esports related subs. I'm an avid gamer (League, Hearthstone, Smashbros) who picked up csgo (and therefore steam) just this past summer, and haven't enjoyed an FPS this much since Halo 1, which I played for my gaming clan that topped out around 250 members and whose forums I've been moderating for a year now. And that experience has taught me how to respond professionally to a variety of people whose posts and/or presence the forum was better without.   As a summer job I've been working with preschool through third graders at a school's summer camp, teaching, and keeping them out of trouble. I was also volunteering as a Homework Help Tutor at a local library this past semester, helping people from elementary to 12th grade with their schoolwork. I try my best to answer people's questions to the best of my ability, and if I can't or don't know the correct answer, I would turn to someone who does in case I'm putting something out there that isn't right. (I also used to frequent /r/summonerschool where you help people new to League of Legends, but I'm not sure how much that counts for)  I would love for the opportunity to invest my time for the community, and keep the subreddit on track as a great place to be for everything csgo related.  Thanks for your consideration. 	http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahampster	GMT-6

Hi, I'm /u/fs0i, and if you mod /r/GlobalOffensive you're bound to have seen a post of mine. I'm a decent coder, and I currently study computer science.  I'm experienced with reddit, I can write any form of markdown fluently.   Actually I'm not really that intrested in modding /r/GlobalOffensive - I don't really have more than one hour / day on average time left. If you guys need any help with CSS stuff, or anything technical I can help. I can write bots that do almost anything what a human can do on reddit.   I'm fairly sure that my programming skills don't suck. I won europes biggest science contest for students, "Jugend Forscht" last year in the area mathematics / computer science. If you need proof for that claim, I can provide this. If you google this you might be able to de-anonymize my account, but so would looking at the owner of my homepage.   One thing I'd like to implement is a live-thread for the next major with scores, killfeeds and some other informations.    So if you need a good programmer in your team, hire me!  (Addition to the Question above: Python is my weakest language. I can read it - no problem! But writing it would be impossible for me without looking stuff up!)	http://steamcommunity.com/id/fs3i	GMT+1

I'm a dedicated Redditor and CSGO player, and I spend a lot of my workday on the closest thing I can get to the game, r/GlobalOffensive.  Even on the toilet, I'm on RedditIsFun on my phone.  And the wife hates it when I Reddit in bed, but I do nonetheless.  I've been involved with this game since 1999, I even went to a 30 player CS Lan in 2000, back before that sort of thing was cool; we played a lot of dust(1), cs_siege, and militia.  It went about as you might expect.  I've been involved with a couple different CS groups, and had some unique experiences, including the time I was recruited to cast a game or two for United5 after my voice was noticed by the other guy playing in a 10man with a girl's CS1.6 team.  I played 7 seasons of CAL-Open, since I liked playing with my friends too much, but I used to scrim with guys from FaceFactor and TeamC9, who were CAL-P and Invite, and at one point, CPL summer top32 finishers.  I'm still CAL-O for life, and can't seem to soloqueue out of Eagle, but my skill at the game isn't important right?  What's important is that I know the scene.  I actually had one of Hiko's old teammates on one of my 6-3 Open teams...  It's on legit-proof.com I think.  Anyway.  I'm excited at the prospect of modding for r/GlobalOffensive, and hope you'll consider me!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/AiRDawG/	GMT-5

I've been "lurking" in your CS:GO subreddit for about a year. I would like to say that I have been helpful in the Newbie Tuesday threads helping out with answering questions, but for the most part they have become "I don't want to look this up plz help!" thus killing my motivation to continue. I took some basic Java, Rhino and Visual Basic in high school but that was about 10 years ago. I've just gotten a book on c++ and will be trying to get my head back into the game. I also recently started playing around in hammer to try and find more ways to squeeze enjoyment from CS:GO. My typical work week is 7 am - 4 pm Tuesday - Saturday. Each day with about an hour of browsing the sub at noon for lunch. When I get home I typically have nothing to do (hence the dabbling in hammer and soon c++ ) and feel like I could be a strong part of the mod team, even if that means I delete low quality posts and reposts while you lads work on actual productive things for the sub. At the end of the day I just want to help out. If you guys don't think I'm worth the risk/training this time around I would appreciate a message on some things you guys are in need of to allow me to educate myself on the subject and maybe make the cut next time around. ps. This is my third or forth application. Thanks you for your time!  -Lyems	http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lye-mz/	GMT-5

Ever since then I have enjoyed a great time, playing 1.6, then Source, and finally Global Offensive. I joined the subreddit when it only had around 50,000 subs. Even though I do not comment a lot, I have vast knowledge regarding the game, the competitive atmosphere, and reddit in general. From time to time, I post on the subreddits and some of my posts have reached the front page. I would strive to keep the subreddit as clean, but dense as possible and because I have a lot of free time, I would definitely make a grand contribution to the mod team and to the Counter Strike community in general.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveling	GMT-5

Ever since I got CS:GO, I have always wanted to be the best! I started as a silver 4, and is now (with a lot of time and effort) DMG. I have also watched a lot of professional CS:GO matches, and loves to see new and different tactics. My English vocabulary is pretty big, and I got the best grade possible in English.  I have had my own subreddit together with a couple of guys. It was a subreddit about a youtuber (/r/BYZE/), I made the flares as well as the banner (The flares got ruined though, because someone screwed around with the files, and I never bothered to fix it). I like to edit, and I really enjoy spending time in Photoshop.  At the moment, I am studying at a boarding school, where we specialize in IT/Media, so we learn a lot of different things, and use IT every day. I have time to help out on the reddit, once school is over (I can also have a look every now and then, while in class), and we have this hour, where we have to be in our room, so there I can devote all my time to the subreddit.  I have followed /r/globaloffensive for quiet some time now, and really enjoy all the user created content. I would love to be a part of the mod staff, and proudly say "I am part of making this a better place for everyone".  I don't really have time to participate in Community Night and Newbie Thursday, since I spend all my time at the boarding school (And I also only have my Macbook air over there).

First off, I don't frequently comment around on the Reddit but I browse very frequently. Something I have told jpon9 before is that I like to help, and that's what I like to do. When I used to play Minecraft, I went through these phases, and everyone did as well. You would play single-player, play multi-player, get bored, and take a break. After this break you would always come back and you could do whatever you wanted. This could be hacking, developing plugins, building, doing graphics, hosting, or running a server/network. What I found I liked was helping people. This lead me into managing servers and networks to now managing my own personal business and managing a design company. Helping people and or players in any way I can was just my niche.  Now on to the introduction part, my name is Brendan and I live in California. Nothing special other then I am in band and orchestra as well as the top performing arts program in California. I also play ultimate frisbee on-and-off and also basketball here and there. My only friends are 5 fish all named to High School English Honors novel characters as well as a beta fish who has no name as of yet. I enjoy sitting down at my computer and playing some games and of course doing whatever I can to help clients for the design company. Obviously I am still going to school and my schedule because of APA and Band is mostly straight forward and exact. I am mostly available after 3-4 on most days and all the time in the afternoon and evening. Most of my experience obviously cannot be shown by text or in an application. And I really wish I could include a CV of sorts. Most of my expertise and knowledge would be better shown by trial. Some of my useful skills that could be put to this would be thriving in team based situations, IT and computer knowledge, goal setting and innovation, organization and planning, and public relations and communications. Those are just some of the many  attributes I can put forward towards the subreddit. I am mature, goal-driven, patient, I always put the best forward, and I try my hardest to excel in whatever is in my path. I cannot stress it enough that helping people and working on whatever they need or want is just enjoyable for me.  Now on to the topic of /r/GlobalOffensive. Like I said above, my post/comment count isn't high and I mostly am I lurker, but I would love to dedicate more of time into the subreddit. Helping out anywhere needed is pretty much what I do. I can especially help out on community related events. I have experience in such practices as well as helping on the Reddit Cup, which I will continue to do in our upcoming one. Without being a mod, helping people is very limited, as most of it would come through mod mail or reports etc. But even if it is just removing and deleting posts and comments, that still seems fun to me. And like I said, I would love to help out in any way possible. Outside of the Esports world I am the manager for a design company. Any of my staff/management/public relations experience comes from that. Our website is http://affluentdesigns.org/ . My main duties revolve around managing our website and social media, working with all of our clients and partners/sponsors, working inside the team, and on public relations and advertisement. Most of my experience from this can play a great part in working as a moderator for the subreddit. Most of my experience obviously cannot be shown by text or in an application. And I really wish I could include a CV of sorts. Most of my expertise and knowledge would be better shown by trial. Some of my useful skills that could be put to this would be thriving in team based situations, IT and computer knowledge, goal setting and innovation, organization and planning, and public relations and communications. Those are just some of the many attributes and abilities that I can put forward towards the subreddit.  Helping on the subreddit as always been a dream of mine you could say. I browse frequently, and I wish I could attend more of the community nights. I added jpon9 after a community night I attended and we talk pretty often I would say. I talked to him in the past about being a mod and how apps are closed and because of me not commenting ever I thought applying wasn't a good idea. We talked about if for a bit and he said we would be looking for new mods later on and I could apply then. Now we are here and I am applying for moderator. Moderating and helping somewhere I already frequently visit would be a great opportunity. The skills I already have and can develop would be a great asset for the subreddit and for the moderating team.  Now for everything above in the application and mentioned on the recruiting post, I have been playing CS:GO for about 3 years now. I don't have any coding experience other than basic HTML and CSS, but can easily learn something to help out in any department. I am soon going to turn 17 and will no longer be taking part in my 2nd stage APA classes, meaning more time at home.  If you want to talk with me more 1 on 1 or have any more questions (Which I would totally prefer), please don't hesitate to ask.  Thank you for the opportunity and reading my application. I hope to hear back from you,  -Brendan (w0lf3)	http://steamcommunity.com/id/calypsocalypso/	UTC-8

I have been a long timer lurker, and a very quiet person for all of my Reddit career. Counter-Strike has become one of my favorite games, and the community, even with it's flaws, is still one of my favorites to be a part of. I would love to get more involved with the community, and be able to assist people that need it. I have developed a vast amount of experience moderating other things in the past such as large scale Minecraft and Teamspeak servers. One of the things that kept me going was knowing that you had made a positive impact on a group or even just one individual. I am very proud of where this motivation to help people has taken me and I would love to be able to assist you in making /r/GlobalOffensive the best place to talk about all things Counter-Strike. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

To start with, I've been redditing for roughly 3 years, a few years in the CS:GO sub, but rarely have I been a really active part of it, I usually chip in when I have something to add and even then, someone has most likely done it before me. I've been playing Counter-Strike for 6 years with over 5000 hours in total, ever since the first Major I've been actively following the competitive CS scene.    About myself; I'm a fun guy to work with, cooperative, I rarely fly off the handle, I tend to keep calm and I try to be helpful whenever I can. I believe I'd make a good fit in the team, while lacking experience when it comes to moderating on reddit, previously I've moderated various other forums, servers, everything from Minecraft to TF2, so keeping discipline among rebels has been a daily routine for me.    I'm most of my free time (that'll be 7 to 10 hours-ish, depending on the day) on my computer, I'm checking the New page whenever I'm hopping through my browser and going through all the comments. In the future, I'm trying to be more active, especially in the case of being a moderator.    Regarding coding, I've written your every day web apps to some enterprise level software. Some recent work include authoring one of the PHP courses for Codecademy and coding for a Minecraft server, where we have shipped plugins and tools with over 1 million total downloads and running on over 10 000 servers.     I'm a bit off your target timezones, but considering I missed the past opportunity, I figured I'd give it a try.  Cheers, looking forward!	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033599735	GMT+2

So I had this entire thing written up, and somehow hit something to refresh the page and now I really do not feel like re-doing it. I will still do it but to a lesser extent. I like being straight to the point, do not enjoy pussyfooting.  In the Navy on shore duty for the next 18 months, ensured to be around for that period of time at the very least because its a steady job/work hours Things learned in the Navy are most of what you're looking for: Comprehensive explanation skills, especially towards the lowest common denominator / attention to detail / separating work from play (ignoring petty shit) [maturity] / Will ALWAYS help, literally no matter what. On the subject of being kind, I'm generally not a friendly person. I don't do kind like normal people do it because I separate a lot of what I do with people and what I do not do with people. I Tend to be Tactfully polite. I will not piss people off, I will be polite, Unless I get livid I always have the option walk away and think about it level-headedly. I am not elitist because someones opinion is based on how they have experienced something, which can be different from how I have. ...Oh yeah, played cs for ~13 years, ABSOLUTELY LOVE the game, 1.6>GO though, lol. If I'm not on reddit I am always on Steam. Love the community that's constantly growing on the subreddit, would love to help it out. I only browse r/all and r/globaloffensive. Well maybe r/csgobetting as well but that's for more information about the pro scene and skins. You should totally hire me because I'm awesome. (does that count as selling myself? Or do I have to go full hooker?)  I do apologize for the format it is in, especially after refreshing and me losing what I had. It's mostly due to me being extremely tired because of the long shifts we had to cover on the holidays these past 2 weeks, and I don't plan on staying up much longer because I need the sleep right now.  So on the serious note, would love to help out if I'm what you're looking for, and if I'm not MOD material in your eyes I am very technologically inclined (Information Security major) so if you want someone to learn programming quick to help you out I have no problem helping there either, but it does help if I'm taught as well lol.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/FLUFFY_DESTROYER_OF_WORLDS	GMT-6

Besides being a frequent user of the /r/GlobalOffensive page (even though i have to admit, i lurk more than i post on /r/GlobalOffensive), I also go on the /r/csgobetting subreddit a lot. In fact, I'm actually a Junior Expert on that subreddit. That mainly boils down to me having a pretty in-depth knowledge of CS:GO and the competitive scene.   I do realize that I've ticked a lot of attributes that were mentioned above. It's not because I'm trying to over-sell or lie about myself, I just really think I can live up to all the attributes that I've ticked.    If i had to choose my strongest attribute from that list, I think that I'm really patient when it comes to helping new users find their feet in the subreddit. Even though I'm not a moderator, I always try my best to interact with the entire community, with one of the examples being creating guides for new users (http://www.reddit.com/r/csgobetting/comments/2n8uot/guide_general_betting_guide_tips_and_what_not/) as well as clarifying whatever doubts they have about the competitive scene and teams. I also created the inaugural /r/csgobetting Awards 2014 as a "fun" platform for /r/csgobetting users to interact with each other and of course, to recognize the best users of the year. CS:GO Scoreboard, a page on Twitter that updates CS:GO competitive games for people that can't watch the game live, was started a few months back by me and a few like-minded individuals who wanted to go the extra mile for CS:GO fans. You can check it out here at http://twitter.com/CSGOscoreboard.   I'm basically always on reddit. Currently I'm doing my internship at a marketing/solutions office which means that reddit is always up on incognito mode. If I'm not on reddit at my PC I'm probably checking out Alien Blue through my iPhone. So yea, it's safe to say I'm always on Reddit. Besides when I'm asleep, of course.   While I'm not a moderator on any subreddits, I have done moderating on various forums in the past. While i can't remember all the names of the forums, the two that spring to mind would be http://www.as-afterparty.com/forum/index.php and http://www.hello-venus.com/. (Yes i know lol they're K-POP fan forums, i was into K-POP a few years back :P. The forums have been pretty dead since 2014 but they were quite active back in 2013). Don't know if this counts for anything but I'm also a moderator on ptr's Twitch channel.   So yes, i apologize if this post is crazy long but i think I've summed up my strongest points. I don't think I have a lot of moderating experience but i hope that by joining the /r/GlobalOffensive team i can learn from you guys and become a good mod myself. I hope you guys consider this application!   Cheers, Josh.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskedapple	GMT+8

I am 15 years old, but I am very mature for my age.  I am incredibly active. I browse GlobalOffensive around every 60minutes to see if there's a new post. I am very interested in being a moderator in this sub forum to help keep it clean and friendly.  15 Years old might seem low but I can assure you that I am incredibly mature and I do not write/sound like a 15year old, nor do I act like one.  I am familiar with python and HTML, I am not fluent but I am easily able to use it to some extent. I am very interested in learning more of it and hopefully other languages.  I am from Norway, it said it was UTC-7 but I am online quite often. In the weekends I'm on to 5am~ and I would be able to keep the sub reddit clean very often.  I am one you can trust, I am not a person that is interested in ruining anything. I am very interested in growing the sub reddit with servers and hopefully a Teamspeak everyone could talk on.  I have a broad knowledge with SSH access and FTP which I hope would be useful.  I started playing Counter strike global offensive in 2012 and I am very interested in the game, I have been following the competetive scene for quite a bit and I really enjoy it.

I'm an avid csgo player having 2 years of experience. I'm currently in high school, but have a lot of free time to play games and browse reddit. Counter Strike is my main game having over 1500 hours of it. If I'm not playing counter strike, I'm probably browsing reddit or watching videos. I go to /new of /r/globaloffensive mostly to try to help others with their problems or to link /r/recruitcs. I feel that I meet most if not all of the credentials that you are looking for. I'm online and available everyday from 5pm to 10pm EST unless something important comes up. I also usually browse reddit during school (8am to 2pm), so I am technically available then.

I am Mitremario.  I started playing CS:GO about a year ago after a close friend introduced me to the game. I quickly became hooked after winning my first match. I have since come to love the game more than any other game to date. I follow the pro scene very closely, especially my favorite teams-iBP, Titan, and NiP. As of now, I have put in 560 hours to this game.  I am often described as helpful and kind by my peers and coworkers. I can see myself helping out on Newbie Thursday by giving advice to newer players in the game. I show my patience when dealing with people who are new to something. Take my parents, for example. When they bought smartphones, I sat down with them and taught them whatever they needed or wanted to know about the uses and features of the device. I am the tech support guy in my family-gladly helping out with computer problems and advising technology purchasing.  I get along well with nearly everyone. I am polite and express my opinion in a careful, respectful, and appropriate manner (generally avoiding controversy when possible, unless the matter is very important to my values).  As for my education, I am in an undergraduate program for Computer Science with a focus in Computer Networking. This is my second year of college. I live in the Eastern US and English is my first and only language.  I started to get into Reddit after I was introduced to CS:GO. I started out lurking on this subreddit, but have been commenting much more frequently. I visit /r/GlobalOffensive several times a day, both on desktop and mobile. It is the first pinned in my favorite web pages. I enjoy reading the top posts of the day, and also reading the new posts and choosing the ones I believe will make the front page of the subreddit. I find myself reading more than commenting on posts, but than can and will definitely change if I get this position, as I enjoy taking on new responsibilities.  I enjoy and respect all the work that goes into moderating this subreddit, and I hope to get to meet the 6 current mods. Thank you for taking the time to read my application.

My name is Brandon. I have played CS 1.6 and CSS for a little when I was extremely young, but never got really into it. I am really young (I'm sorry.) and I have been a moderator for a few forums (not reddit), but they all shut down for inactivity. I have advanced knowledge of CS:GO and have over 1000 hours. I would like to help further improve this community. I find myself on the computer most of the time, unless I am off doing something else. I am on half of the days of the week, because my parents are having issues, and I switch from house to house, and one of the houses has really bad internet. But! On the days that I am on, I am on usually all day. I signed up for Reddit a few months ago, and followed Reddit, but really didn't pay attention to it until now. As I said, I recently just got back into the Reddit community. I enjoy helping others. I am not experienced in any programming/coding languages, but I am willing to learn.

My name is Emil, I live in Sweden and I go by the name of "xWeeze" or "Wozi" on social media and such. I make YouTube videos basically as a job, and I'm about to reach 60,000 subscribers. I've been doing YouTube videos for almost four years now.  I've been playing Counter Strike and following the competitive scene for almost a year now, started in February. I play everyday, I watch all the matches and I'm on the Global Offensive subreddit more than anything else. ^^  I am 14 years old (almost 15) but I like to think that I act like a very mature 14 year old. I am in front of the computer almost all the time, even in school, so I am available all the time. If my very annoying VAC-ban makes any difference, I would like to say that I have never cheated in any game except for Euro Truck Simulator, and that that VAC-ban is from Modern Warfare 3. I had recently bought a 144Hz monitor, but MW3 was looked to 60fps, so I had to use an "FPS Unlocker", and unknowingly, VAC did not enjoy that.  In any case, I would love to be a moderator on /r/GlobalOffensive. ^w^  Oh, and happy new years!  	http://steamcommunity.com/id/xWeeze_	UTC+2

I'm an Indian living in Toronto, and I've been playing CS:GO pretty much ever since it's release. I've been taking the game seriously since the end of last year.  In most of the boxes that I checked, I am not completely sure if they truly define me, but I think that they do. I found it difficult to answer those as I think it's better for someone else to describe me than myself. "Mature", and "Experienced with reddit" were difficult options. I think that I am patient at times but I can get impatient as well.  My ability to stay available usually depends on whether I have tests/exams, but I'm online almost everyday. I am not sure if based on my comment history I count as a frequent commenter. If the baseline is "comments a fair bit everyday" then I probably am, but otherwise, probably not.  My knowledge of CSGO is probably not advanced, but one of my tips is on the wiki. Not that it matters too much but I left it unchecked because I can't make a call on this, and I think that you guys are probably much better suited to judge that.  I have only basic experience with HTML and C#, and moderate experience with Python. The meat of all my programming was in Java and Python.. However I haven't developed anything that I consider useful- if there's something that I need there's usually a free application available for it, or manual tweaks to windows does the job . Also, I do consider my programming experience in the context of web development to be extremely rudimentary, but I'm willing to learn on the job. Unfortunately I probably can't dedicate enough time outside the job to do that.  I may not be as active for as many hours as you guys possibly need. What I do know is that I can't pull all-nighters and sacrifice on sleep, unless I have a holiday. Regardless I put in this application because I want to contribute to the /r/GlobalOffensive community and improve myself in the process. With this kind of growth you guys definitely need more people on the job.  Thank you for reading this long introduction.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/duelistgamer/	GMT-5

Although I am not in the time zone that the Mod team requested, I am awake during the time that I suspect they want mods on. I am generally on reddit during the middle of the night(for me that is). Generally I am on reddit for 3 to 4 hours per day, and most often lurk, unless I feel I can contribute something worthwhile to the conversation. When not actively on reddit, I generally will check reddit every couple hours just to go through the front page and respond to messages.  Although I only know Python and HTML, I would very much like to learn more programming languages.  *Bonus Points* I am well acquainted with the professional Counter Strike scene (due to my betting and general interest in the game) I am also a moderator on a surf server in csgo (name of "Surf Public - Dallas USA"), and have become acquainted with many high level surfers.

My in real life name is Daniel and im a 19 year old educated salesman from Sweden, I currently work as a phone support for a swedish phone company called Telia and I enjoy that very much.   What do I do in my spare time?  I love playing Globaloffensive with my friends and I also play a lot of ESEA and Faceit. I would also like to go to as many CS:GO major events as possible and see my favorite team NiP (surprise huh? :D) compete against the best teams in the world. I remember my first CS:GO event which was Dreamhack Winter 2013 and I was instantly in love with seeing competitive CS:GO. I do also play some League of Legends, and playing it at a pretty high level. Playing games is my passion and it is what I love doing during my spare time.   Why am i applying for a moderator for Globaloffensive subreddit?  I'm a very active user of Reddit and even though I'm mostly a lurker I read almost every post on the front page aswell as a lot of new posts. I also have advanced knowledge about Reddit and even though I have only been a redditor for 12 months I'm certain I have learned enough to be able to do a decent job in helping out around here.   I'm also very passionate about details when helping people such as giving them directions and adding that little bit of extra information that they might need help with.   Other qualifications that I have is I'm fluent in both writing and talking English, I'm an active computer user for about 10 hours a day when not working, about 5 hours a day when working. Im generally a very happy and positive person who loves teamwork and I'm more than certain that the Globaloffensive team is a great minded and spirited team!

I currently frequent /r/GlobalOffensive, although i'm rather new to the Counterstrike franchise (CSGO was my first) I'm in no way new to first person shooters, I've essentially been playing them since as long as I can remember. being new I thankfully managed to pick the game up rather quickly, and now I actively try to help new members of the community as best as I can.     I have no prior experience with moderating on Reddit, but I used to run a forum fansite for a game called "Runescape" With that I picked up a lot of basic PHP, HTML, Javascript. Despite it never being super active, I think it peaked at 10 people online once. It still came with it's fair share of issues(trolls, flamers, spammers etc) despite being a small community.   Some other web based work I did Is I used to run a Minecraft Server hosting "Company"- It's in quotes because nothing was really official. this is when I started to pick up on programming a tad bit more. Using dedicated servers and such rather than free web hosting services.   This actually got relatively popular, revenue was 200$CAD+ per month Hosting approximately 14 servers at any time, this lasted about 8 months. With this I was everything. The guy who kept the website up. They guy who made sure everything is working. I was customer service, everything you'd need for a service like that to run, I was him,.  I dealt with multiple parents of children who know nothing about the game itself, but are happy to tell me everything I can do and how I'm a horrible person and they just want there money back and 6 free months and..., you get the point. So, I delt with a lot of that and other similar things that'd test just about anyone's patience. Learned alot from running it, tempted to try and get it going again.   Anyways I'd be happy to help with moderating the subreddit. even if I don't land the position. I wish you luck finding the right person for the job :D.  	http://steamcommunity.com/id/xayx/	UTC-5

Hello mods of /r/GlobalOffensive.  I'm /u/PM_ME_YOUR_UNIDAN_  I would love to moderate this place as I come here more frequently every day. Check my comment history. I'm on this sub, actively commenting and discussing different things with others. I have a somewhat understanding of modding although I will need that 30 day trial for much more than you guys checking me, although I do know about reddit and its nature if that helps with anything.  I am almost always online although due to school I obviously won't be here 24/7, but other than that, I spend extensive hours in front of my computer and will definitely have the time to mod this sub.  I live in the UK so there's a good chance that I will be able to participate in things like community night. Even though I may be wrong about what I said I can still participate in those things easily.  Now for the bonus points.  I like to think of myself as pretty knowledgeable with the pro scene of CS:GO. I have started to play since the first major (I started in December 11th 2013) and since I became really involved in the esports community and essentially it opened up a lot of new knowledge for me to use. As for CS:GO itself, I actually made my own team. We play tons of scrims and I devote a lot of my time to learning map strats and watching pro demos/streams, so I'm good in that department as well. I'm actually in the middle of learning JavaScript and HTML so I will definitely be able to use that to my advantage if there ever comes a time for that.  So yeah. That's me, if I missed anything out the mods reading this can point it out in a reply, and I will gladly reply/edit this.	http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057403259	UTC+1

I also helped on r/tf2scripts and r/tf2scripthelp, and contributed to  r/truetf2.  I'm mature and always very objective.  I don't comment that often, but I am a very active lurker. I only comment when I strongly disagree with someone and have evidence against them, or if I see a comment that doesn't have a reply that I don't know the answer of.  Pretty much on Steam/Reddit as long as I'm awake, either in CS:GO or with it open in the background at work.  I try keep up to date, and help people where I can, when it comes to CS:GO knowledge and promoting the competitive scene.  I'm a full stack Python developer, mainly focusing on Django (Python web framework), but sometimes I have to write PHP. I also know javascript pretty well.

I was interested in the competitive scene when I saw team3D play at cpl winter. They became my favorite team and I would love watching ksharp and rambo play. I started playing on esea and got destroyed but improved as a player and played consistently over the years. I may not be consistent with my aim as much as the pro players but I definitely have their mindset. I would like to become a mod because I feel like I can really give back to the community. My main role I would want to play is to answer peoples questions about the game in general and help people improve. I have a real passion for counter strike that not many people have. I would love to be apart of something where I can give back to the community. You can never have too many people helping out new players right? I would give this game a great image and welcome new players and make them feel comfortable. I am definitely missing many points that could make me a viable mod but it is 5:13AM here and I am very tired. I hope to hear back. Thanks for your time	http://steamcommunity.com/id/wevatron	UTC-5

I'm /u/Nyrazis, 19 in June next year, and I'm a recent inductee into the CS:GO community. I've only been playing CS:GO since a few months ago, although I do have prior experience with CS 1.6.  I am, however, experienced with a lot of video games, including MOBAs such as League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm and Dawngate, RTSes such as the original Warcraft series and Starcraft 2, as well as FPSes such as Battlefield and Call of Duty (well...)  I have been on Reddit for longer than a year, primarily on subreddits such as /r/leagueoflegends and /r/AskReddit. I try my best to make a fair amount of my posts insightful posts, and not low-quality "shitposts" intended as detrimental to discussion.  I have made Post-Match Threads for the League of Legends subreddit:  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dj31o/spoiler_international_wildcard_grand_finals/  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dfdw0/spoiler_legacy_esports_vs_russian_force/  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dfliq/spoiler_dark_passage_vs_legacy_esports/  While I have also contributed to the LoL subreddit's Travel Compendium for our World Championships that took place a few months earlier (the contents of the thread were used in the overall Travel Compendium, probably verifiable by /u/xAtri):  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2e3e4d/four_days_in_singapore_world_championships_2014/  I am from Singapore - English is my native language, while I have an A-level equivalent proficiency in Chinese (Mandarin). This proficiency roughly equates to a C1 on the CEFR scale:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages  I am also currently learning Japanese and Korean, with A1 and A2 proficiency respectively.  In my posts, I frequently intend to balance discussions and educate opinions via providing greater information on my areas of experience or expertise in order to prevent discussions from spiralling into accusation-lobbing without evidence. I am also, in turn, receptive to contrary opinions and will be willing to change in the case that I am proven to be either overzealous or wrong in my opinions.  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/294qzd/a_lot_of_negativity_on_korean_forums_regarding_s4/cihhs88  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/207m3d/got_in_a_random_cab_in_singapore/cg0pxur?context=3  I am currently a subreddit moderator of /r/OGN, a somewhat under-publicised unofficial fan-made subreddit for the OnGameNet network of eSports broadcasts, which include eSports such as League of Legends, Hearthstone and Starcraft 2 - specifically, the Korean scene of these eSports. This was an initiative undertaken by members of the /r/leagueoflegends community, in conjunction with some members of the other respective eSports. We plan to increase publicity for our subreddit when the eSports season kicks off again for OnGameNet, which is in early January. This also explains the relative inactivity you may see on the subreddit as of now - it is the off-season, with not a fair amount of headline-garnering movement in the Korean eSports scene.  I do not profess to be a proficient subreddit moderator. In fact, I am probably fairly inexperienced in moderation. However, I am very convinced that if I had the privilege of joining your ranks I will work as hard as I can to prove myself.   I also do not profess to have a lot of experience nor proficiency in CS:GO. However, I am always willing to improve, and am always receptive to insights and knowledge.   I sincerely hope that you consider my application.   Thank you for your time.	http://steamcommunity.com/id/thespianspark/	GMT+8

I live in Sweden on a small island called Smögen. I started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive about a year ago, I've played for about 227 hours total now and have been following the competitive scene closely. You may wonder why I only have about 200 hours even though I started playing a year ago, that is because I got tired of playing because i didn't have friends to play with due to them not wanting to lose their rank playing with a "new" player. I eventually started playing alone though and i have gotten lots better. I am still stuck in silver hell though, because i keep playing with my best friend who is not very good at the game, I keep trying to give him advice but he makes the same mistakes over and over again. I mainly play with my MG friends now instead but I still play with him from time to time. I am online on Steam and Reddit for about eight hours a day and more on weekends. I am always glad to help and give advice to new players and i have alot of experience dealing with such people. I have been a redditor for 3+ years and understand how everything works around here. As for my young age, I'm pretty much done with puberty, so no hormone-fueled bad decisions will be made on my part.  I hope you consider picking me as a moderator. Message me if there is other stuff you would like to know. Have a great day!	http://steamcommunity.com/id/confidenttooth	UTC+1

Because of this Im very active on twitch.tv and almost always online since i work from home i know its not a popularity contest but i mod for allot of channels i bring this up to show i can be responsible and trusted.  I've formed good friendships/relationships between alot of the north american and European professionals and members in the community.  Also i would love to participate in the reddit community nights because i love to help new players get into the game, me and Reverential if you guys know him constantly play with new people and coach them into csgo and help them get better.  One of my main goals would be helping the csgo community in the UK grow and get bigger since there isnt a huge amount of players that get into competitive play outside of MM. Because of my work hours i have tonnes of free time so im just applying to get into the community more and help make the subreddit a friendlier place. Above anything else one of my main qualities is how social i am, i love getting to know new people and players in the community.  I don't have any experience with programming at the most i use powershell and msdos occasionally when im doing tech support. Im willing to learn if needed.

Brief intro: My name is Alex I’m 18 years old and I live in Las Vegas NV. I currently take a lot of my courses online so I am online the majority of the day/evening. I’ve been playing CS:GO for about 7 months now. It’s the first CS title i’ve played and i’ve been enjoy it a lot.    My moderation history: I’ve moderated various forums,game servers and chat rooms for the last 5 years. Back about 5 years ago I was quite into Club Penguin, I decided to make a website/forum about Club Penguin. I worked on it for about 10 months and at one time there was over 400 users on. So I quickly had to start learning how to moderate the first month or two was a bit hard I won’t lie. Luckily I had a few good friends help me get the hang of it. I quickly realized I enjoyed moderating a lot. Towards the end of those 10 months activity dropped a bit and I overall grew out of Club Penguin.  At that time I started joining various chat’s mainly on Xat. Having learned a lot from my moderation of my forum I started get well known on Xat for being a good moderator. I started with some smaller chats >100 people on at a time and after a while of working hard on helping the users in the chats. The head of Xat’s help chat offered me a spot as a moderator so I accepted. Now this was a big chat for this site over 500 people on at peak times. I had to do a lot of work on the help chat since a lot of people loved to troll. I still remember the first time 100+ trolls raided the chat and I was the only one online. That was a very long night. I mainly answered any support related questions about the website and the things they sold. I also had the job of being the go to raid guy since I had very fast key binds so I could ban the trolls quite fast.So at the time I accepted being a mod for the help chat I was moderator of 20 chats. That had an average of 3000+ people on during peak. I stayed moderating the help chat for about 2 years and was even promoted to “owner” of the chat. The ranks were guests,members,mods,owners and main owners. So I was quite happy to be promoted to that. After the 2 years I decided to leave the chat. It was a very hard decision but it was definitely the right one.  After that I took a break from moderating for a while. About 7 months later one of my very good friends got me into Minecraft. We decided to set up a public all-purpose server. The server started out very small but after advertising it for a while we would get 100 users on at any given time. Me and him both were the main moderators (we brought a few “helpers” in once the server started getting to about 700 people on at any time). I banned around 2000 people during the year we had the server up. Mainly for either hacking or for bad fellowship (pretty much overly swearing or harassing players). Around a year after we started the server my friend decided he wasn’t into Minecraft servers anymore. So we decided to sell the server to a rather big network. This brings us to the last year about a year ago I found a Minecraft server called Playmindcrack. Now this was a big network had 2000+ people on at a time. I love being helpful so I spent a decent amount of time talking to the users and trying to answer all their questions. Around 6 months ago the current moderators asked me to join the moderation team. I’ve spent a decent amount of time the last 6 months mainly banning people for hacking or violating our harassment/bad fellowship rule. It’s been quite enjoyable and I recently got offered Senior Moderator there. The servers activity has been quite low recently so i’ve been taking some time off from Minecraft. So i’ve been looking for a new adventure to help people with.   Cs:Go So as I said earlier i’ve been playing Cs:Go for about 7 months now. It’s different from most of the games i’ve played before and i’m really hooked on it. I’m currently a silver elite player with 127 comp wins and 500 hours in game and i’ve enjoyed every minute of it. I mainly play Cs:Go for fun I don’t get to annoyed even if we lose 16-0 as long as i’ve had fun. I’ve met some incredible people over my time playing so far that will be my friends for a long time.   Bit more about me: My families originally from Antwerpen Belgium, I’ve lived in the states on and off since i’ve been born. I have a rather strong dutch/french accent. Besides doing a lot of stuff on the computer my other hobbies are basketball, football (soccer) and fitness. I spend quite a bit of time reading reddit I mainly lurk but would be more then happy to start posting more. I also do quite a bit of online poker recently won a small online tournament.   Finishing thoughts: I once again wanted to thank you all for all the hard work you do keep the subreddit a great fun place. I’m sorry for my application being quite long this reminded me of a lot of fun times. Thanks again for this incredible chance. I’m excited to hear your response.   Thanks again Alex (GoldLobster) Lobster   	http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldLobster/	GMT-8

While I'm not exactly into the pro competitive scene, I know my way around the teams a little bit and occasionally watch matches in my downtime.  I love the game and know enough about it to be helpful in the community.  I recently became an OP in the r/globaloffensive IRC channel, something I have quite a bit of experience with -- meaning moderation of online communities is something I have done for many years though not always on Reddit.  I do moderate one subreddit but it's very small and not at all typical of the majority of subreddits.  It does lend me the background to know the basics of subreddit moderation, however.   I work as an IT Director and systems administrator, and have plenty of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, and PHP.  I used to be part of the Amazon Mechanical Turk community where I wrote quite a few scripts to help the workers, using mostly Javascript and jQuery in extensions like Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey, and making use of several jQuery plugins for charts and graphing. Here's a link to my greasyfork page with the scripts I have contributed: https://greasyfork.org/en/users/3342-deliriumtremens  I do know how to implement the languages outside of those extensions and have written a few tools for my job in PHP and Javascript.   Python is something I have learned in my free time, feel free to check out my small github page to see the projects I have hosted on there: https://github.com/DeliriumNocturnum/  I've had a basic introduction to Node.js but it would be irresponsible of me to say I have any noteworthy experience with it.  I think I would be a good addition to the r/GlobalOffensive moderator team.  I can communicate succinctly and effectively, and can work with the others to combat some of the negative presence in the subreddit.  I understand you would prefer a heavy commenter, and I can certainly change that since I often read through the majority of comments in the threads I visit.    If you have any questions please shoot me a message on Reddit, or feel free to contact me at jake@schwartzpub.com and I will be sure to respond as soon as I have a chance.
