				Hello, /r/GlobalOffender! This page is for selecting a special flair based on aspects of your Steam account and CS:GO profile.<br><br>
				The process involves authenticating via Reddit and Steam consecutively so we can ensure you are... well, you! At no point in time do we ever have access to your private login credentials for Reddit or Steam -- we use OAuth and OpenID respectively to verify your account, which is the standard method used by every third party app and website.<br><br>
				To begin, please <a href="../link">click here</a>.<br><br><br><br>
